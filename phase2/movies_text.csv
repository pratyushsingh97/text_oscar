0,Escape Room,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/movies/escape-room-review.html,"I tend to esteem motion pictures more for their aesthetic value than for their use value but sometimes there are exceptions. Through scrupulous and heightened simulations of terrifying reality, last year’s “First Man” reminded me why I never even entertained the notion of becoming an astronaut. Taking the opposite tack with an irrational but not altogether implausible conceit, “Escape Room” reminds me why I’ll never engage in the newfangled form of entertainment in which you allow yourself to be “trapped” in a room and puzzle-solve your way out of it. The conceit is that this movie’s game masters absolutely intend to kill the six invitees who at first find themselves in a waiting area that turns into a people-cooking oven. The players, mostly adult but still “Breakfast Club”-ish, include a female war veteran, an overachieving but friendless collegian, a dirtbag grocery stock boy and a too-pragmatic finance guy. The screenwriters Bragi F. Schut and Maria Melnik and the director Adam Robitel steer this not-all-that-intriguing crew through a series of challenges, in spaces that the production designer Edward Thomas clearly enjoyed putting together. (The upside-down bar is particularly gnarly, especially once the ceiling panels start dropping out.) The puzzles aren’t constructed in a way that gives the viewers any sort of whack at them; we merely watch as the characters solve or don’t solve them, then start dying for real. There are intimations of “Tales From the Crypt,” “Final Destination,” “The Game,” and other older, better films here; this movie never catches a fire like any of those did, and even its twist coda feels dreary and pro forma. But the movie is keeping me even further away from real-life escape rooms than I already had been."
1,Rust Creek,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/movies/rust-creek-review.html,"When horror movies head for the woods, their titles may vary — “I Spit on Your Grave,” “Wolf Creek” — but their central dynamic is too often the same: At some point, an attractively trembling woman will be forced to run like the dickens from a yokel who butchers his own meat. What sets “Rust Creek” apart from most of its genre predecessors, though, is that its director, screenwriter and cinematographer are all women. Sadly (or happily, depending on your viewpoint), this hasn’t made an appreciable difference to the broadly familiar beats of Julie Lipson’s screenplay, even if Jen McGowan’s direction is as attentive to stasis as action. Midway through the movie, when the lead character, a Kentucky college student named Sawyer (Hermione Corfield), finds herself trapped in a trailer with Lowell (Jay Paulson), a hinky meth cook, her slow transition from suspicion to trust is accomplished with near-subliminal sensitivity. The sequence, and the uneasy alliance it forges, is the most compelling feature of a plot that could easily have graced a couple of episodes of Graham Yost’s chewy 2010-2015 television series, “Justified” (also set in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern Kentucky). When Sawyer is stranded on a side road en route to a job interview in D.C., the arrival of two gun-toting yahoos is no surprise. More unanticipated is Sawyer’s response to their twitchy offer of a bed for the night: Neutralizing both the skeevy Hollister (Micah Hauptman) and burly Buck (Daniel R. Hill), she legs it into the woods. And that’s the first problem: Sawyer is so resourceful that we never fear for her. A gaping knife wound in her thigh fails to slow her roll until she’s out of immediate danger. Later, she devises an escape from bondage using lye and some barely credible contortions. Though slight of build, she’s a match for every lunk in her path, to the point where I fully expected her to show up at state Police Headquarters with her remaining adversaries trussed like turkeys. Well-acted and technically sound (Michelle Lawler’s photography is clean and clear), “Rust Creek” falters with superficial characterizations and a cliché sheriff (Sean O’Bryan) who’s as incompetent as he’s crooked. Corfield is fine in a role that gives her little opportunity to do more than run and fight, but a woman this empowered removes the question mark from her survival — and the tension from the movie."
4,The Upside,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/movies/the-upside-review.html,"What a difference a cast makes. If the director Neil Burger’s decision to have Bryan Cranston and Kevin Hart play the leads in the odd-couple comedy “The Upside” — a remake of the 2012 French film “The Intouchables” — doesn’t erase the original’s sins, it blurs them just enough. As a result, this impolitic (some might say offensive) tale of Phillip (Cranston), a wealthy, white quadriplegic, and Dell (Hart), the black parolee who restores his will to live, is surprisingly winning. Some squinting will be required to block out the race and class stereotyping, as well as the puddles of sentiment scattered throughout the highly predictable plot. Yet Jon Hartmere’s script has genuinely funny moments and is blessedly short on crassness: even a scene involving catheters and colon hygiene is less cringey than you might expect. A warm vibe between the two men goes a long way toward sweetening the sap and contrivances. When the vastly unqualified Dell stumbles into a job as Phillip’s caregiver, he’s rewarded with an eyebrow-raising salary and a depressed patient who needs entertaining more than cosseting. Mutual benefits multiply, as the two share joints, prank the police and bond over Mozart and Aretha Franklin. Later, when Dell’s hostile ex-girlfriend and son resist his amends, a new house and car prove remarkably persuasive. Inspired by a true story, “The Upside” isn’t shy about turning the travails of disability into punch lines — or Nicole Kidman, as Phillip’s devoted business manager, into a romantic cliché. But Hart (who needs a counterweight to his Oscar-hosting controversy) is less manic and more genuine than we’ve seen him, making Dell more than just a comic device. And Cranston never oversells his hobbled character. Now imagine if the filmmakers had summoned the creativity to swap their roles."
10,The Kid Who Would Be King,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/movies/the-kid-who-would-be-king-review.html,"In 2011, the British writer-comedian Joe Cornish delivered a promising feature directing debut with “Attack the Block,” a wild, irreverent science-fiction action-comedy about an alien invasion thwarted by a gang of tough teenagers. That film, which also gave us the screen acting debut of the future “Star Wars” favorite  John Boyega, was not a huge hit, but gained cult status over the years, prompting speculation about what its talented writer-director might do next. It’s taken eight years for Cornish to release another feature, and it may feel strange at first to see him at the helm of a modest children’s adventure about a modern-day King Arthur. But “The Kid Who Would be King” still has some of the wit and sweep that distinguished Cornish’s earlier work. The film’s setup is simple. The meek 12-year-old Alex (Louis Ashbourne Serkis), chased into an abandoned construction site by the school bullies, comes upon a sword stuck in a hunk of stone and pulls it out. A Latin inscription on the weapon suggests that it may well be Excalibur, the legendary sword of King Arthur, although Jack and his best pal, Bedders (Dean Chaumoo), initially decide that’s a ridiculous notion. Circumstances soon change. Flaming demons appear in the middle of the night and torment our bewildered hero. Out of the mists of Stonehenge emerges the rather odd-mannered young wizard Merlin (Angus Imrie), who enrolls himself at school under the name of Mertin. (“Greetings, fellow academicians,” he intones to the other kids. “I am a perfectly normal contemporary English schoolboy!”) He then tries to convince Alex and Bedders that the world needs their heroism at this very moment, for a variety of reasons. For starters, the country seems divided, and political and social discord rule the land — a bit of real-life relevance the film doesn’t pursue much further. More urgently (and cinematically), Arthur’s mortal enemy Morgana (Rebecca Ferguson) is emerging from a centuries-long slumber, intent on enslaving humanity. What ensues is a brisk, well-mounted children’s fantasy, with Cornish giving the story an entertainingly apocalyptic spin. Children covered in armor drive “Mad Max”-style cars to combat the forces of darkness, while their school turns into a hellscape of warfare and fire. The action is creatively staged, without ever getting too intense or scary for young viewers. And the script balances humor, pathos and wish fulfillment as it portrays Alex’s rise from mopey dreamer to confident warrior, without overdoing the mythic portent."
11,Serenity,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/movies/serenity-review.html,"I’m no actor, but I’d like to think if a script ever came my way with lines like, “Wouldn’t it be funny if nobody knows anything?,” and “Just how many years have I been here, Jack?,” and “How dare Old Joe feed my cat,” I’d know that the movie would probably open in the middle of January when the studios leave their garbage on the curb. But I’m just me, so it’s possible that Matthew McConaughey was sent the pages for “Serenity” and saw something more fit for April or May, when the movies don’t need quite as much cologne. It’s also possible that he read the script — with its tale of a chain-smoking, heavy-drinking, sweat-soaked fishing boat captain, his ex, her battering new husband and the elusive tropical tuna that haunts the captain’s every waking hour — and recalled the last time he was on the high seas then said aloud, “I miss ‘Fool’s Gold.’” More than half the reason I went to see this movie is because I miss “Fool’s Gold,” too. But that movie is 11 years old. And the days of low-stakes thingamabobs with some stars and even a little bit of writing are gone. Instead of a caper with Kate Hudson, McConaughey has got a mess written and directed by Steven Knight. The captain — his captain, Baker Dill — has unsexy sex with Diane Lane’s character. He tries to catch that fish alongside his dutiful first mate (Djimon Hounsou). He puts up with the nerdy, White Rabbity stranger (Jeremy Strong) chasing after him and managing the return of Karen, this ex of his and mother of his son. She’s played by Anne Hathaway, as a blonde, and her arrival at the local bar appears to be an event so momentous that the camera has to sprint-swoop around her to gawk. I laughed when it did. Baker Dill is a lousy character name. But that camera pivot is lousier. Karen asks Captain Dill to take her mean spouse (Jason Clarke) for a boat ride but doesn’t ask to bring him back. But maybe Dill would rather catch that fish than commit murder. So Karen keeps alternating between femme fatale and mysterious detective-novel damsel until he consents. For reasons known only to Knight, “Serenity” couldn’t just be a film noir. He’s laid some kind of science-fiction nonsense atop it because, apparently, the movie needed a ply of trashy pretension to echo Adrian Lyne’s thriller “Jacob’s Ladder” and complement the luxe incoherence of McConaughey’s Lincoln ads. There are cutaways to Baker and Karen’s son feverishly typing code while, offscreen, his stepdad can be heard slapping Karen around. (It’s possible that Baker can hear his son — telepathically!) The more we learn about that half of things the less sense the rest of the movie makes. That includes a big reveal that’s like the worst of Christopher Nolan, M. Night Shyamalan and the condolence-card section at Walgreens."
13,Miss Bala,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/movies/miss-bala-review.html,"In “Miss Bala,” Gina Rodriguez chops an onion, shoots an AR-15 and does various other things that might count as spoilers if I told you about them. Or not, if you’ve seen the trailer. Rodriguez, looking for action as “Jane the Virgin” winds down, finds it as Gloria Fuentes, a Los Angeles makeup artist ensnared in the cross-border drug trade. Gloria, who travels to Tijuana to help her childhood friend Suzu (Cristina Rodlo) prepare for a beauty contest, is basically in the wrong place at the wrong time, something that might be said for everyone involved with this movie, audience included. Which is too bad. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke (“Thirteen,” “Twilight,” “Red Riding Hood”) from a script by Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer, “Miss Bala” has pretty solid DNA. It’s more or less based on an earlier film of the same title directed by Gerardo Naranjo and starring Stephanie Sigman, which used action-thriller techniques and moods to explore the corrosive effects of narco trafficking on the lives of ordinary Mexicans. The inescapable power of the cartels gave that “Miss Bala” a feeling of claustrophobic terror and sometimes absurd fatalism. It was an intense, almost hallucinatory parable of utter vulnerability and desperate compromise. This version, in the dreariest Hollywood-remake tradition, turns a grim, morally ambiguous story into a fable of empowerment. That might be kind of fun if it didn’t feel so tired and timid. Rodriguez shows a little spark early and late, but mostly she is stricken, scared and shut down. Which is understandable given the character’s predicament, but the movie itself exists in a similar state. Any disturbing implications of Gloria’s situation — any ethical quandaries, psychological insights or genuinely shocking circumstances — are kept in check. What happens around her is horrible, but not so horrible as to stand in the way of her ultimate triumph. After a wild shootout in a Tijuana nightclub, Suzu disappears, and Gloria, who saw some of the gunmen when they sneaked in through a bathroom window, finds herself first in the custody of a kingpin named Lino (Ismael Cruz Córdova) and then face to face with a D.E.A. agent named Brian (Matt Lauria). This is a distinction without much of a difference. Neither one is very nice to her — though Lino tries for something like gallantry — and they may not even be on opposite sides of the law. But Gloria is stuck with Lino, who calls her “Chula” and occasionally touches her. He doesn’t go any further, apparently in the hopes of seducing his captive. Instead, the brutality of his gang and their rivals — directed against minor characters — is depicted with a mixture of sensationalism and squeamishness that feels sleazy and dishonest. Sex trafficking and wanton murder are part of their business, but “Miss Bala” keeps a safe, titillating distance from the worst of it. The fact that nearly all the characters are Mexican or Mexican-American hardly lessens the sense that we are watching a parade of caricatures and clichés. The denouement suggests we are also watching the first episode in a franchise, but even that, while ridiculous, hardly seems shocking."
14,Velvet Buzzsaw,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/movies/velvet-buzzsaw-review.html,"If you want to see a clever actor having a great time, watch Jake Gyllenhaal in the opening minutes of “Velvet Buzzsaw.” He plays Morf Vendewalt — just one of several eyebrow-raising character names — an intimidatingly influential and improbably affluent art critic, in his element as he half-strides, half-minces his way through an exhibition hall at Art Basel Miami Beach. He trades his designer shades for boldly framed eyeglasses, turns his gimlet eye on various sculptures and paintings and drops depth-charged bons mots. The writer-director Dan Gilroy makes the film’s contempt for the contemporary art world crystal clear from the outset, but puts Morf in an interesting position: As insufferable and pompous as he is, he has his own can’t-be-bought integrity. He also has ambition, and is quick to exercise it. When Josephina (Zawe Ashton), the humiliated protégée of a powerful gallery owner, discovers a cache of striking “outsider art” in the apartment of a dead neighbor, she enlists Morf, now her lover, to be the artist’s biographer. It’s here that “Velvet Buzzsaw” itself morphs. Initially a sour satire, it starts to play as if it were an expanded vignette from one of those ’70s British horror anthology films like “Asylum” and “Tales That Witness Madness.” Artwork turns murderous: As the grim back story of the neighbor comes to light (he killed a man! he painted with his own blood!), people pushing his work start meeting nasty deaths. Unfazed is the powerhouse dealer Rhodora Haze (Rene Russo) — see what I mean about those character names? — who imperiously stage-manages the buzz as bodies pile up. I found the horror stylings of the movie pleasantly old-school — oh no! a painting’s wild animals are moving, and they’re coming for you! — but I wonder whether they’ll satisfy contemporary “Saw”-crazy audiences. Gilroy’s pacing is adept, and the movie creates a what-will-happen-next tension, even as he continues to lather bile on his target. Gyllenhaal and Russo also starred in Gilroy’s 2014 directorial debut, “Nightcrawler,” an elaborate condemnation of broadcast journalism that played like an overheated cross between “Network” and “Taxi Driver.” Paparazzi and contemporary art are two topics apt to bring out sneers from Hollywood types who consider themselves too refined and clued in to be, well, Hollywood types. Nevertheless, a lecture on how the art world needs to disconnect itself from profit motive coming from a filmmaker who co-wrote “Kong: Skull Island” is pretty rich. Still, the confident storytelling and the bravura acting — Daveed Diggs, Toni Collette and John Malkovich contribute compelling caricatures — carry “Buzzsaw” all the way home. By the end of the picture Gyllenhaal has given us something we rarely see in movies: a credible portrait of a pretentious person’s nervous breakdown. Also, I’d be lying if I didn’t say that a couple of Gilroy’s jibes do stick their landings; one sequence in which a real corpse is mistaken for an art installation has a zing that Ruben Ostlund’s vinegary 2017 “The Square” never got within a mile of."
15,Piercing,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/movies/piercing-review.html,"A grisly comedic thriller written and directed by Nicolas Pesce (his 2016 horror film “The Eyes of My Mother” got some positive notes), “Piercing” has an audaciousness that largely lies in splitting the difference between viewer interest and viewer exasperation. A movie that begins with a father (Christopher Abbott) standing over his newborn’s crib holding an ice pick behind his back can’t be said to be pulling any introductory punches. Soon, Abbott’s character Reed hears the newborn instructing him to murder a prostitute. He travels from his stylized apartment building (outside views of it look like a diorama) to a stylized hotel. There he rehearses a horrific murder and dismemberment while the Brazilian musician Zé Luis’s “Soneto of Love” plays on the soundtrack. This brand of Tarantino-brewed, Williamsburg-aged hipster irony was tired around the time that “Things to Do in Denver When You’re Dead” came out (over 20 years ago), but Pesce does have some other tricks up his sleeve. Most of them borrow from the style of the lurid Italian films called giallos: Cult-picture aficionados will be tipped off by the bright yellow hotel-room phone. When an S&M-specializing call girl (Mia Wasikowska) shows up, things get bloody, although not in the way you’ve been led to expect. “Piercing” is adapted from a novel by the Japanese author Ryu Murakami, who also wrote “Audition,” which was made into a great thriller two decades ago. Pesce violently divorces Murakami’s work from its socioeconomic context in favor of a more generalized war-between-the-sexes dynamic. The movie gains momentum as it indulges in hallucinogenic phantasmagoria. Whatever you make of its intentions, it’s certainly exceptional in its visual distinction. “Piercing” also leads up to a wryly funny punch line that made this viewer a little more forgiving of its plentiful affectations."
16,The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/movies/the-lego-movie-two-the-second-part-review.html,"The new animated Lego movie is pretty much like the last one. Or maybe I’m thinking of another one, not that it much matters. There are differences between editions, most fairly negligible. The unifying factor, to note the obvious about the state of big-screen children’s entertainment, is that they are all feature-length commercials. The “Transformers” series helped pave the way for Legos by flipping the old idea that movies (like “Star Wars”) were the creative source for the licensed merch, the lunchboxes and action figures. Now, toys, board games and so on are sometimes the originating point. This isn’t news; I know it, you know it. But it seems worth repeating again and ad infinitum, especially given that “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part” isn’t as distractingly fun, shiny and bright as the more satisfying franchise installments. It drags and sometimes bores, which makes it easier for your mind to drift elsewhere, to thoughts of family, deadlines, chores, the creative impoverishment of the big studios and the casual, fundamentally corrupt commercial exploitation of the child audience. Put differently, what distinguishes this from the better Lego movies is that they’re good commercials. The new one was written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the franchise’s brain trust, and directed by Mike Mitchell, whose credits include “Trolls,” another toy-based feature. “The Lego Movie 2” mostly takes place in Bricksburg, the happy town where once upon a time in the buoyant 2014 movie, Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt), an upbeat dude in an orange vest, triumphed to become a heroic master builder. Five years later, life in Bricksburg has turned into a George Miller-esque dystopian hellscape. Emmet still looks on the sunny side, but everyone else, including his pal, Lucy (Elizabeth Banks), looks like Lilliputian refugees in their own decrepit and sand-swept “Mad Max.” That sounds more promising than what transpires in the movie, a busy, noisy clutter of action sequences, pop-cultural allusions, life lessons and cute critters. The clever if rather cynical, self-reflexive back story involves live-action scenes of a bickering big brother and little sister who, unbeknown to Bricksburg, are the true master builders. The children’s disharmony makes trouble in their play world, draining it of color and optimism; in other words, everything is not awesome, to borrow the franchise’s insanely catchy theme song. There’s a tidy message here: Be nice to your kid sister, which is supernice advice especially because the movie was produced, directed and written almost entirely by men. The exception is the animation director, Trisha Gum, who worked with Mitchell on the movie’s look and feel, which is by turns immersive and wittily distancing, as when the Bricksburg story is interrupted by a shot of a toy dangling from a string. One pleasure of the Lego movies is how they personalize generic plastic bricks, creating a sense of life by combining scratches and other signs of the human hand — as if a child had used and reused these toys — with distinct, caricatured voices. Will Arnett’s demented take on Batman remains the standout, and it’s disappointing that he isn’t given more to do. In line with the live-action siblings, the under-inspired Emmet and Lucy drive the Bricksburg part. Much of the story involves an eerily smiley alien land (shades of Camazotz in “A Wrinkle in Time”) where Batman is to marry the polymorphous queen (Tiffany Haddish). Every so often, the kids and their mom (Maya Rudolph) pop up in the live-action scenes, and their family dissonance creates chaos and intimations of doom in Bricksburg until it doesn’t. The moral is that we should play nice, but also buy truckloads of Legos. In this respect, this sales pitch fits in with something that Walt Disney, a marketing genius, once said about his company not catering “to the child but to the child in the adult.” He was talking about his films’ viewers, who also happened to be the folks destined to foot the toy bill."
17,What Men Want,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/movies/what-men-want-review.html,"“What Men Want” presumes a lot of things about its viewers. One is that they won’t tolerate a satire of workplace sexism if it doesn’t sometimes put the woman in her place. Another is a taste for Fiji water, an object of product placement so frequent that you worry for a drought in the South Pacific. Directed by Adam Shankman, this comedy flips the script on Nancy Meyers’s “What Women Want” (2000), in which a Chicago chauvinist (Mel Gibson) gets his comeuppance after gaining the power to hear women’s thoughts. This time, the mind reader is an Atlanta sports agent, Ali (Taraji P. Henson), who works at a boy’s club of a company and is repeatedly passed over for partner status. Her boss, Nick (Brian Bosworth), tells her, “You’re doing great in your lane.” But thanks to either a knock on the head or the laced tea given to her by a psychic (Erykah Badu), Ali begins to hear what men are thinking, the better to get sweet, sweet revenge. Part of the message, of course, is that it doesn’t take a mind reader to see that Ali’s colleagues — who court a star African-American basketball player (Shane Paul McGhie) with a racist video filled with bling and women — are complete boneheads, working in a frat house dressed up as an office. [Read our interview with Erykah Badu, who got her start in acting before turning to music.] While “What Men Want” starts off as a stinging critique, it undermines that message with one of Hollywood’s favorite idiotic subplots. Because the star player’s father (Tracy Morgan) doesn’t trust a woman without a family, Ali tries to pass off a one-night stand and his son (Aldis Hodge and Auston Moore) as her husband and child. Presumably Ali’s ability to hear their thoughts would make that charade easier. So would a simple conversation. But Ali is a bad communicator, and one lesson the movie deigns to teach her is to listen more carefully. If the original delivered payback to a sexist, the new film ought to let a victim of sexism turn the tables. “What Men Want” doesn’t stick to that conceit, however, despite such barbed moments as when Nick says aloud that he would fire Ali if he didn’t fear a #MeToo outcry. The film insists that Ali, like Gibson’s ad man, receive her comeuppance: She learns to respect her gay assistant (Josh Brener) and to be less selfish in her career and in bed. Memo to working women: Don’t be ball busters, or else. The gender politics of “What Men Want” only sometimes play as retrograde, though. The movie covers all its bases, determined to give every segment of the audience what it wants, with dubious success."
18,Cold Pursuit,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/movies/cold-pursuit-review.html,"The wintertime Liam Neeson sad-dad action thriller for 2019, “Cold Pursuit,” is just like most of the previous specimens and also completely different. This time, instead of rescuing a daughter, as he did in “Taken” — the bellwether of this beloved or at least unavoidable subgenre — Neeson is avenging a son. His character, Nels Coxman, is not a globe-trotting assassin with a highly specialized set of skills, but rather a humble Colorado snowplow driver. For an amateur, Nels is awfully good at killing, and he takes to it with a grim determination that could easily be mistaken for enthusiasm. Neeson’s recent revelation, in a newspaper interview, that he once came close to acting out his own racist revenge fantasies might spoil some of the fun. For his part, the director, Hans Petter Moland, is clearly having a blast. Why else would he have bothered to remake his film “In Order of Disappearance,” (2016) in which Stellan Skarsgard played a Norwegian snowplow driver named Nils Dickman? (The screenwriter on this version is Frank Baldwin.) Nels’s methodical, bloody extraction of payback is, as usual in this kind of story, righteous, sadistic and wildly disproportionate. On top of the bodies he dispatches himself, there are dozens of casualties in a war he unwittingly sparks between rival gangs of drug dealers. After members of one of these outfits inject Nels’s son, Kyle (Micheal Richardson, Neeson’s oldest son), with a fatal overdose of heroin, Nels works his way up the org chart, picking off guys with colorful underworld nicknames like Limbo and Shiv. At the top of the odious heap is Viking (Tom Bateman), a smug and vicious helicopter parent who forces his young son to drink green smoothies instead of the sugary cereals that are every American child’s birthright. Viking is a perfect ideological Rorschach blot of a villain: You could read him either as a preening liberal elitist or as a coldblooded Ayn Rand techno-capitalist, depending on what you hate most. Or maybe you think that’s a distinction without a difference. Whatever works. The mano-a-mano mad-dad duel between Nels and Viking — spiced with hints of class and generational conflict — gets complicated when a third angry father is added to the mix. That would be White Bull (Tom Jackson), head of a Native American crime family. A truce between his people and Viking’s falls apart when Viking assumes that White Bull’s people, rather than Nels, has been killing off his minions. White Bull goes after Viking’s kid, and a patriarchal free-for-all ensues. Pity the minions. Moland pursues the mayhem with a degree of lowdown wit and a troll’s eye on the potential sensitivities of the audience. Each time a man dies, he is memorialized with a tasteful death notice on a black screen, with his real name as well as his underworld alias, and a glyph suggesting which maker he has been sent off to meet. There are a lot of crucifixes and totemic eagles, with an occasional Star of David, Om sign and peace symbol thrown in for good measure. It’s like one of those “Coexist” bumper stickers, and also kind of the opposite. This is the part of the review in which I note that “Cold Pursuit” traffics in a bunch of dubious stereotypes and some questionable sexual politics. This will make some of you mad at the movie, some at me. White Bull’s band of Indians — who were Serbs in the Norwegian original and would be Mexican or Colombian in most Hollywood exercises of this kind — are half-noble, half-comical savages, mocked and honored in turn, as they were in the old westerns. Just for fun, Nels has a brother, Brock (William Forsythe), whose gold-digging Asian wife (Elizabeth Thai), a former massage parlor worker, is basically a walking ethnic joke. The other women in the movie fare only slightly better, except for Laura Dern, who plays Nels’s wife and gets out as quickly as she can. Emmy Rossum as a ski-town cop is supposed to remind us of Frances McDormand in “Fargo,” but bases her successful police work on the sexual manipulation of some poor sap in Denver. She is encouraged in this by her patrol partner (John Doman), who otherwise embodies what happens to a white man when he gives in to the imperatives of political correctness. Perhaps you think the same about me. I don’t really care. And please don’t get me wrong. I’m not accusing “Cold Pursuit” of being casually sexist or accidentally racist. On the contrary: Its misogyny and racism strike me as perfectly deliberate, if also mostly disingenuous. That is, the movie works very hard to provoke a reaction like the one in the previous two paragraphs to justify the inevitable counter-reaction. Why make everything political? Lighten up, snowflake! It’s just a movie. And enjoying it can feel like an act of rebellion. Which I totally get. I have kids and grievances of my own and blah blah blah. I can’t deny that the glum, resentful, not-giving-a-damn masculine vibe of “Cold Pursuit” has its appeal, as does Moland’s blunt knack for efficient screen violence. As for the star, Neeson has whittled his winter persona down to a haggard nub of weary anger, purging any inkling of gentleness, melancholy or self-awareness. The deadpan extremity of his performance is almost funny, except that in light of what we know now about Neeson’s past, it’s not funny at all. The thirst for revenge, in movies as in life, almost necessarily involves the dehumanization of its target. And if the movie itself is best taken as a joke, it’s a very bad dad joke."
19,High Flying Bird,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/movies/high-flying-bird-review.html,"On a basketball court, “give me the rock” means “pass the ball.” In “High Flying Bird,” an exhilarating and argumentative caper concerning a sports agent, his N.B.A.-rookie client and other interested parties, the phrase takes on a slightly different connotation — something akin to “the workers should seize control of the means of production.” Notwithstanding the presence of three real-life professional ballers (Reggie Jackson, Karl-Anthony Towns and Donovan Mitchell) giving straight-to-camera testimony about life in the league, this isn’t a sports movie in any conventional sense. Directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Tarell Alvin McCraney, it uses the charisma of athletes and the competitive energy of the game they play to catalyze a feisty, twisty fable of labor and capital in the 21st century. McCraney, a formidable playwright (his “Choir Boy” is currently on Broadway) and an Oscar winner for “Moonlight,” has composed a densely layered, intellectually demanding agitprop drama that draws on rabble-rousing theatrical traditions (Clifford Odets, Dario Fo) while fixing its gaze squarely on the injustices and absurdities of the present. Soderbergh, shooting almost entirely with an iPhone, conducts a brisk tour of the streets and suites of money-mad Manhattan, with excursions to Philadelphia and the South Bronx. It’s very much worth digging into the political economy of the movie, but more important, at the outset, is to pay tribute to its craft and ingenuity. McCraney’s script is quite simply an extraordinary piece of writing, idiomatic and poetic in its cadences and pleasingly serpentine in its structure. The challenge for Soderbergh and the more-than-game cast is to turn the artful verbiage into persuasive human speech and the plot machinery into a plausible slice of organic reality. Which it is, helping down the medicine of topicality with the sugar of pop-culture cleverness in the most delightful way. The slightly distended frames and peculiar angles of the pocket-size camera — and the way Soderbergh, serving as the director of photography under his usual pseudonym, Peter Andrews, makes it twirl, glide and shimmy — create an atmosphere of buoyancy and immediacy. The actors take it from there, above all André Holland, an executive producer of the film and the third member of its central creative team. Holland (a vital part of both “Moonlight” and “The Knick,” Soderbergh’s Cinemax series) plays Ray Burke, an agent who finds himself in a tight professional and ethical spot. The team owners have locked out the players (as happened in the N.B.A. back in 2011), and the money that keeps everybody afloat is quickly drying up. In the first scene, Ray is lecturing his client Erick Scott (Melvin Gregg), a recent No. 1 draft pick whose professional debut has been postponed, about financial responsibility and personal discipline. It’s a big-brotherly scolding and a pep talk, but also the beginnings of a ruthless critique of the way the system works, exploiting naïve and ambitious young men like Erick even as it promises them fame and fortune. That idea — that in spite of high salaries and endorsement deals, athletes are fundamentally workers, generating profits for the owning class — is refined and complicated as Ray pinballs from one meeting to the next. He checks in at the office with his boss (Zachary Quinto), engages in energetic screwball banter with his erstwhile assistant, Samantha (Zazie Beetz) and argues dialectics and family-leave policy with Myra (Sonja Sohn), the head of the player’s association. Other encounters — with a no-nonsense sports mom (Jeryl Prescott), the owner of Erick’s team (Kyle MacLachlan) and Ray’s old friend Spence (Bill Duke), who runs a youth basketball program — follow the same didactic, disputatious pattern. There’s a fair amount of soliloquizing and rhetorical grandstanding, which is also true of Shakespeare, hip-hop and church. If you like any of those, you might enjoy this too. In the course of all the back-and-forthing, a scheme emerges that strikes Ray as wonderfully simple and potentially revolutionary. What if the players, paralyzed by the intransigence of their employers, could eliminate those middlemen and take control of the fruits of their own talents? It’s a question that resonates beyond the court, the locker room and the broadcast booth, into the worlds of art and entertainment. The racial aspects of the power dynamic that governs organized sports is so obvious that it almost goes without saying. Whenever anyone does say it — when, that is, somebody invokes slavery as a metaphor for current circumstances — Spence demands the recitation of a short prayer: “I love the lord and all his black people.” If there is resignation in those words, there is defiance too. “High Flying Bird” swoops and cuts through the contradictions of modern culture with the fleet momentum of a power forward destroying a flat-footed defense on his way to the hoop. You don’t quite understand what just happened until the next thing is already happening. The intellectual virtuosity on display is somehow both ostentatious and casual. The performances — Holland’s in particular, full of sadness, guile and audacity — feel the same way. Not everything works. A back story having to do with Ray’s cousin, a basketball prodigy who met a tragic end, feels like the kind of baggage more suited to the stage than the screen. At moments the busyness of the plot overshadows the wit of the performances. But the occasional raggedness of the movie only enhances the credibility of its ambitions. Like Ray Burke, it’s in a big hurry and has a lot on its mind. And it leaves you with a lot to think about, in addition to race, class and basketball: what it means to love your work, and why it matters to be paid for it; how utopian visions and tactical calculations work together to create the possibility of change; why we take fun so seriously. It ends not with a big game or a high-stakes showdown but with a protest anthem — by Richie Havens, who also performed the song that gives the film its name — and a recommendation for further reading. Which I am not about to spoil."
20,The Prodigy,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/movies/the-prodigy-review.html,"In “The Prodigy,” a ho-hum horror movie given a mild boost by its credible performances, a small boy named Miles (Jackson Robert Scott) begins to exhibit disturbingly supernormal intelligence. Further red flags include sleep-chatting in Hungarian, abusing his babysitter and battering a classmate with a wrench. If this isn’t evidence enough of Miles’ bad-seed credentials, he also has one brown eye and one blue — weird eyes being a dead giveaway in the evil-spawn genre. Miles might be a little devil, but it’s not the Prince of Darkness who’s messing with his head. Enter a lanky psychologist with a very particular set of skills (Colm Feore), none of which prepare him for those of his pint-size patient. Yet the movie’s occasional chills do little to obscure the thin plotting, problematic pacing and a central mystery that’s left aggravatingly vague. Jeff Buhler’s script reveals too much too soon in a moodily photographed prologue showing a crazed killer mowed down by police while his latest victim escapes with one hand fewer than when she was snatched. Directed by Nicholas McCarthy and set in a weirdly depopulated Philadelphia (played by Toronto and its environs), “The Prodigy” features the usual buzzing flies and de rigueur jump scares (the best of which is in the trailer). Taylor Schilling is perfect as Miles’s distraught mother, who catches on so slowly that she seems a little dense. And because fathers are often sidelined in movies like this, Peter Mooney’s restraint in the role, when the camera does find him, is to be heartily commended. Toying fruitlessly with themes of reincarnation and the transmigration of souls, “The Prodigy” gives the audience little to muse on except who will make it to the end credits. And with how many appendages."
22,Happy Death Day 2U,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/movies/happy-death-day-2u-review.html,"In “Happy Death Day,” a 2017 slasher variation on the classic time-loop comedy “Groundhog Day,” a prickly but engaging college student, Tree Gelbman, had to solve her own murder in order to stop reliving the day it happened. Once that was done, the minimally witty movie implied that she’d live in a less dodgy fashion than that which got her killed, over and over again, in the first place. The cosmic conditions that created this fix were not explained in that picture. But, boy, are they ever in the sequel “Happy Death Day 2U,” written and directed by Christopher Landon, who directed the original film and penned several films from the “Paranormal Activity” franchise. Turns out a student experiment in the quantum physics lab is responsible for shifting realities, and Tree soon finds herself catapulted back to her death day. Under different conditions this time, one of them happy: In this dimension, her beloved mom is still alive. But she is still going to die every day. While the first film worked a relatively simple “solve the mystery and save your life” challenge, here Tree uses her predicament as a grand self-help course, not unlike Bill Murray’s character in “Groundhog Day” and his piano lessons. Jessica Rothe as Tree is still an appealing presence. But the film is overstuffed with unfunny self-parodying gore slapstick, half-felt sentimentality and semi-meta sci-fi — characters mention “Inception” and “Back to the Future,” just to let you know that they know that we know. It ends as neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring. This, despite the preponderance of herrings thrown about during its running time."
23,Alita: Battle Angel,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/movies/alita-battle-angel-review.html,"At one point in “Alita: Battle Angel” — another dystopian fantasy that reminds you of just how visionary the original “Blade Runner” was — the cyborg heroine gets a new body. It’s a streamlined shoulder-to-foot job, one that makes her look like a sex doll with a chrome-plated musculoskeletal system. Her new physique turns out to be an innovative weapon and comes with articulated parts, a wasp waist and what looks like a discreet chastity panel for the groin. It also has larger breasts than the old model, a change that in a snort-out-loud line is pinned on Alita’s own ideas about how she should look. If only someone here were joking or had an idea about the construction of femininity. Why does Alita (Rosa Salazar), who has a human brain, even have breasts? Why does any cyborg that isn’t a sex bot or a wet nurse? Genre convention only partly explains the onscreen look of this character, originally created by Yukito Kishiro in his manga series. Kishiro sexes up his cyborg, an amnesiac who in the first comic retains one protuberant breast when the rest of her body is destroyed. This brings to mind Jessica Rabbit, the bodacious femme fatale in “Who Framed Roger Rabbit” who purrs “I’m just drawn that way” — yeah, but by whom, for whom and why? “Alita” is the latest from James Cameron, though he takes only some of the blame. He helped produce the movie and shares script credit with Laeta Kalogridis (they collaborated on “Avatar”); he was going to direct it himself but handed it off to Robert Rodriguez (“Sin City”). The presence of other “Avatar” veterans — the senior visual effects supervisor, animation supervisor and so on — raised expectations that “Alita” would at least look good, different or inspired. But too much of its overall design feels borrowed, by turns evoking the monochromatic clutter of “District 9,” the vertical favelas of “Ready Player One” and the randomly milling, anonymous hordes of whatever. A pileup of clichés in service to technological whiz-bangery, “Alita” is one more story of the not quite human brought to life with hubris and bleeding-edge science. It takes place in the 23rd century after a global cataclysm called the Fall. The movie’s story, inspirations and allusions (Hitchcock!), though, more rightly announce it as a 20th-century artifact, one that begins when Alita’s head and shoulders are found and refurbished by a paternalistic doctor, Ido (an atypically uneasy Christoph Waltz). Theirs is a post-apocalyptic meet-cute that morphs from yet another riff on Frankenstein’s monster into a sitcom-y father-and-daughter duet, plus brawling and exposition. The story proceeds by fits and starts with a narrative line — Alita’s journey of self-awareness — that is embellished with a dreary old-fashioned romance and regularly interrupted by chaotic action scenes. Some of this crash-boom stuff takes place during a game called Motorball, one of those survivalist contests that have been a genre staple since at least the 1975 film “Death Race 2000.” The contestants have something to do with Vector (a wasted Mahershala Ali), a regulation villain who takes fashion cues from “The Matrix.” This being a very small world, he lives with Ido’s ex, Chiren (Jennifer Connelly), who when not selling her soul lounges in garters and stockings. Everything here tends to remind you of something else, including Alita, who was created with performance capture. This involves monitoring and recording a performer’s movements using sensors attached to her face and body, information that becomes the foundation for a character that’s digitally fleshed out. Cameron used a version of this technology to greater effect in “Avatar,” a reminder that whatever his limitations as a filmmaker — he’s a great visual storyteller who’s invariably easier on the eyes than ears — he is a technological wiz. Salazar’s performance, alas, is consistently bland, but then she was drawn and directed that way, like Jessica Rabbit. It’s easy to imagine that both Salazar and Rodriguez would have fared better if her face had been left alone rather than rendered into a stylized manga cartoon, complete with a heart shape and eyes even bigger than Emma Stone’s. It’s vaguely diverting to stare at Alita’s face, at least at first, to ponder its shape, texture and pale color, and the way that her brow furrows when she’s being emphatic. Mostly, though, what’s interesting about it is that it lacks the conviction, the spark, which turns truly wonderful animated creations — Disney’s Pinocchio, Hayao Miyazaki’s Ponyo — into characters you laugh with and weep for. This is a matter of style, inspiration and imagination, or their absence. There’s so little at stake in “Alita: Battle Angel” that it blurs into uninvolving spasms of visual and aural noise as it lurches to the cliffhanger ending, a setup for promised sequels. If you stick around for the end credits, you will read that “the making and authorized distribution of this film supported over 15,000 jobs and involved hundreds of thousands of work hours.” In other words, piracy threatens the American movie industry, even if a chunk of the jobs here seem to have originated outside the United States. It’s still a worthy wag of the finger, although it’s difficult not to wish that more of those hours had been spent telling a really good story instead of tweaking tech and shiny breasts."
24,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/movies/how-to-train-your-dragon-hidden-world-review.html,"“How to Train Your Dragon” may not be the most beloved of computer-animated franchises, but it is one of the most reliable. The latest installment, “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,” gives the now-trilogy a pleasing arc. In the first movie (2010), Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel), through a secret friendship with a not-so-fearsome dragon, Toothless, broke with centuries of Viking tradition to bring about a cease-fire (and cease-firebreathing) in human-dragon affairs. In “How to Train Your Dragon 2” (2014), Hiccup refined his leadership skills, ending the movie as a worthy successor to his father, Stoick (Gerard Butler), the chief of Berk, and his mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett), a pioneer in dragon whispering. More bittersweet and less triumphal than its predecessors, and directed by a returning Dean DeBlois, “The Hidden World” concerns the exigencies that Hiccup faces as a leader, both politically and personally. If you truly love that dragon you trained, its message says, let him go. As the movie opens, Berk is, in Hiccup’s estimation, “the world’s first dragon-Viking utopia.” But it’s not so utopian: Overcrowding is a problem at mealtimes, and the high concentration of rescued dragons in the settlement has made Berk a target for hunters. The most fearsome of those is a new villain, Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham, chewing on the cartoon scenery), who lives for the thrill of the chase and is always one step ahead of Berk’s peace-loving populace. Should the residents hold strong, or must they abandon their centuries-old home? Is Berk just a state of mind? And is Hiccup finally ready for marriage with Astrid (America Ferrera)? Toothless, thought to be the last of his breed, meets a female counterpart and is quickly smitten. But is she on the level, or is Grimmel, who has Toothless in his sights, using her as bait? Never the most sophisticated of digital dynasties, plot-wise, “How to Train Your Dragon” makes the most of these questions. If you’ve spent any time with these characters, it’s hard not to get swept up in the saga, and it’s easy to be moved by the bond between Hiccup and Toothless, who is, in effect, a very loyal dog who can fly and harness the power of lightning bolts. The skill and detail with which the dragons have been rendered has only improved over the three films, and in sheer numbers, “The Hidden World” probably offers the most dragons per minute. The hidden world of the title — which Hiccup is searching for — is their secret ancestral homeland, depicted in glowing pastels that suggest a geological kinship with Pandora from “Avatar.” But mostly the movie aspires to be goofy fun. Hiccup plays Cyrano during Toothless’s mating dance with his mysterious lady-dragon friend. Several former Judd Apatow associates (Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are back as comic relief, although you suspect that some of them — along with Kit Harrington as a reformed dragon hunter and Butler — stopped by the recording studio only briefly. And unusually for a sequel, this installment has the courage to feel conclusive. The series has earned affection for its characters and its disarming premise. Now it’s time to let it go."
25,Fighting with My Family,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/movies/fighting-with-my-family-review.html,"The brood in “Fighting With My Family” is a rambunctious crowd. There’s mum and dad Knight, and a handful of adult kids (one’s doing time). Professional wrestlers all, they grapple with one another in and out of the ring while running a gym in Norwich, England. They know how to put on a good show, how to turn the mat into a stage with thumps and grunts, stomps and smashes. The family that smacks down together stays together, or at least that’s the idea in this charmer about love and choreographed war. The writer-director Stephen Merchant plunges into the domestic fray straightway, opening with a peek at the Rock, a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson, living the dream on the Knights’ television. Johnson is one of the movie’s producers as well as one of the story’s leading talismans, the embodiment of the Knight family ideal. A poster of him from his title glory days hangs in the bedroom of the family’s daughter, Paige (Florence Pugh), who’s been wrestling since she was a young teenager. Alongside her older brother Zak (Jack Lowden), Paige is carrying on a tradition begun by her parents, Ricky (Nick Frost) and Julia (Lena Headey), who found salvation both in each other and inside the ring. Like all genre movies, sports stories tend to cling to a familiar template, one involving struggle, tears, heart, soul and triumph — cue the cheering crowd. “Fighting With My Family” isn’t much different, which is extremely and shrewdly on point for a movie about professional wrestlers with bigger-than-life personalities and flamboyant stage names who, in a circumscribed space, deliver precisely coordinated, rule-bound narratives of victory, agony and defeat. Like genre cinema, professional wrestling strikes a balance between convention and innovation, between what the crowd knows (expects) and the surprises, the little deviations from the usual script, that can drive it to its feet. Much of the movie turns on a sibling rivalry that upends and nearly rends the family when Paige, selected at an audition for World Wrestling Entertainment, is shipped off to a Florida boot camp. (W.W.E. Studios helped make the movie.) While Paige — a Goth girl with a heavy curtain of jet-black hair — struggles to fit into the competition, where the tanned and the blond rule, often in bikinis, Zak licks his wounds at home, trying and generally failing to deal with disappointment. As Merchant toggles between Zak in Norwich and Paige in Florida, he settles into a familiar struggle between authenticity and artificiality, a seemingly odd divide on which to hang a tale of professional wrestlers. If it works, it’s partly because of the easy allure of authenticity narratives, even the most contrived. Paige considers the other female competitors suspiciously, unwittingly condescending to them because she doesn’t view them as real wrestlers. For Paige, her authenticity is a given, even if her professional persona — which changes along with her wrestling name — is a construct. Merchant gently plays with this idea, mostly to fill in the story as she progresses from obliviousness to self-knowledge and the inevitable third-act clinch. (The genesis of the movie is an entertaining, more open-ended Channel 4 television documentary about the Knights, “The Wrestlers: Fighting With My Family.”) Merchant is probably best known for the original British version of “The Office,” which he helped create. He doesn’t do much with the camera in “Fighting With My Family,” which has a filmmaking style that’s best described as functional. But he has a terrific cast (including Vince Vaughn as a coach), pinpoint timing and a gift for visual japes and physical comedy, for arranging bodies in funny formations and for underlining everyday absurdity. Merchant also has a sense of flow. Even when the jokes are as blunt as the bowling ball that Ricky delivers to another wrestler’s groin — they’re testing out a dubious routine — they just slide into the story, becoming part of its textured realism Like its amiable, irresistible ménage, “Fighting With My Family” softens its rougher edges with humor. It’s often broadly funny but never mean or patronizing; it takes the Knights, their eccentricities and quixotic aspirations seriously, but not enough to squelch the fun. At times, particularly when the family is in its element at its gym (a.k.a. World Association of Wrestling, a.k.a. W.A.W.), which does double-time as a refuge for young neighborhood strays, the movie evokes the working-class milieu familiar from British filmmakers like Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. Merchant doesn’t seem keen to score political points, but he nevertheless quietly delivers some truths amid the laughter and hurt."
27,Greta,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/movies/little-women-review.html,"“Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents.” That’s the first sentence of “Little Women,” and I’m happy to say that in this gloomy holiday season — when so much of humanity has earned Krampus or coal — the new movie version of Louisa May Alcott’s novel comes as an absolute gift. A whole stocking full, really. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, this “Little Women” — the latest of many adaptations — embraces its source material with eager enthusiasm rather than timid reverence. It is faithful enough to satisfy the book’s passionate devotees, who will recognize the work of a kindred spirit, while standing on its own as an independent and inventive piece of contemporary popular culture. Without resorting to self-conscious anachronism or fussy antiquarianism, Gerwig has fashioned a story that feels at once entirely true to its 19th-century origins and utterly modern.  Some of that freshness comes from the cast, a cornucopia of effervescent young talent ballasted by a handful of doughty old-timers. There is also an exuberance — an appetite for clothes, books, baked goods and adventure — that effortlessly links then to now. At the center of the hullabaloo, as she was in Gerwig’s “Lady Bird,” is Saoirse Ronan. She plays Jo March, the second oldest of four sisters living in Concord, Mass., during and after the Civil War. The foursome varies by temperament and talent, inviting a mix-and-match game of identification and infatuation. The oldest, Meg (Emma Watson) is theatrical and responsible; Beth (Eliza Scanlen) is musical and sweet. The youngest sister, Amy (Florence Pugh), and Jo are a painter and a writer who are frequently at odds. Before romance, tragedy and the ordinary pains of growing up complicate matters, they are an inseparable if not always harmonious troupe. Jo writes the plays that the rest of them perform for an audience that includes various toys, their mother (Laura Dern) and Hannah (Jayne Houdyshell), the housekeeper. But the sisters live mainly to delight (and sometimes to torment) one another. The spectacle of their natural, affectionate, clamorous intimacy is a joy to behold, one we occasionally glimpse through the amused eyes of potential suitors, fond neighbors and a prodigiously judgmental and very wealthy aunt played by Meryl Streep. The girls’ nonjudgmental, non-wealthy father is played by Bob Odenkirk. Rather than starting where Alcott does, during an austere wartime Christmas, Gerwig introduces us to Jo seven years later, an ink-stained scribbler paying a visit to a New York publisher (Tracy Letts). The rest of “Little Women” zigzags between two periods in the lives of Jo and her family. Whereas Alcott traces their fates in a straight line, Gerwig (aided by the deft editing of Nick Houy and the musical stitching of Alexandre Desplat’s score) proceeds by association and recollection. It’s as if the book has been carefully cut apart and reassembled, its signatures sewn back together in an order that produces sparks of surprise and occasional bouts of pleasurable dizziness. This chronological shuffling jolts the story awake and nudges the viewer to pay close attention. Like any good novelist and every great filmmaker, Gerwig isn’t afraid to let her audience work a little. She trusts our intelligence and our curiosity, and also her own command of the medium. Reshuffling the plot is a way of making “Little Women” more cinematic without resorting to tricks or gimmicks. As much as “The Irishman” or “Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood,” this is a film that tackles the mysteries of time. In Gerwig’s hands, the specific magic of the medium — its ability to reorder the sequence of events, to slow down and speed up, to project memory ahead of experience — becomes a tool of philosophical and emotional inquiry. We observe the March sisters becoming who we have always known them to be, and also figuring out, for themselves, who they are. Their simultaneous comings-of-age take place amid the constraints and opportunities of their time, place, class and gender. The publisher who buys Jo’s sensational tales instructs her that women in fiction must wind up either married or dead, and “Little Women” the movie obeys that imperative, though not in quite the same way that “Little Women” the novel does. Romance arrives in the person of young Teddy Laurence (Timothée Chalamet), the slightly dissolute grandson of a wealthy Concord widower (Chris Cooper). Laurie, as the sisters call him, seems at times more like a fifth March sister or an untrained puppy than like boyfriend material. He can’t even sit properly in a chair! Meg, by consensus the prettiest of the four, falls for Laurie’s tutor (James Norton), which means that her wedding vow is also a vow of poverty. The more practical-minded Amy, counseled by Aunt March, grasps the economic implications of marriage. Jo, who catches the eye of both Laurie and a certain Professor Bhaer (Louis Garrel), might prefer not to marry at all. The question of freedom — in particular of a woman’s independence in a society that is both liberal and governed by tradition — is threaded through nearly every scene. “I’ve been angry every day of my life,” Mrs. March says matter-of-factly, and while “Little Women” is full of silliness and sorrow, sweetness and warmth, it doesn’t minimize or apologize for that anger. Nor does it mock or marginalize the March family’s commitment to social justice, civic responsibility and artistic excellence. All of those were, for Alcott, part of the mainstream of American culture. Gerwig knows that they still are. And so is this kind of entertainment: generous, sincere, full of critical intelligence and honest sentiment, self-aware without the slightest hint of cynicism, grounded in the particulars of life and accessible to everyone. Don’t let the diminutive title fool you. “Little Women” is major. It seems fitting to finish with Alcott’s last sentence: “I can never wish you a greater happiness than this!” Little Women Rated PG. Domestic struggles. Running time: 2 hours 14 minutes."
28,Triple Frontier,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/movies/triple-frontier-review.html,"The tough-guy chatter and feelings in “Triple Frontier” are somewhat more rarefied than in the usual grunting action flick. That’s the idea, at any rate, in this slickly enjoyable, bankrupt take on a fail-safe formula, one that celebrates an ethos even more enduring than patriotism: old-fashioned American greed. And so, once again, rugged he-men with sensational skills, character arcs and Michelangelo musculature set off on a mission deemed impossible. Tom Cruise’s career suggests that these operations are entirely possible, as does every other movie about rakish charmers facing hopeless odds. Sometimes these prickly and smooth charmers are ex-cons; on occasion they’re soldiers (“The Dirty Dozen”) or veterans (the original “Ocean’s Eleven”). Their mission takes different forms but is generally goal-oriented whether the objective is sabotage or a fat payout. The American vets in “Triple Frontier” come in the usual flavors, including a gruff top dog, faithful second in command, wild card and so on. All are easy on the eyes. The top dog delivers a St. Crispin’s Day-style throat-catcher and as usual tells the recruits they’re free to leave, no hard feelings. No one does. Then it’s game on with guns and ammo, followed by squabbles, screw-ups and a terrible sacrifice — honorable, of course. The director J.C. Chandor sells used goods with verve. (His movies include the superior “All Is Lost.”) “Triple Frontier” takes off with a banging overture loaded with the familiar sights and sounds of a phalanx of police vehicles breaching enemy lines, a helicopter swooping overhead. In a generic country that I’ll call South Americaville, the police descend on a drug-gang lair and bad guys and good point, shoot, fall, die amid a hailstorm of bullets that’s topped by a cataclysmic explosion. After the smoke clears, the cool American number apparently running the show, Santiago (Oscar Isaac), turns his back on the police who summarily execute detainees, suggesting that he isn’t the story’s heavy. No one is here except the generic drug lord (Rey Gallegos) who’s in Santiago’s sightlines because, well, drug lords are evil. In the fairy-tale world of action movies, even one that pretends it has a few ideas, malevolence is often a matter of individual bad agents rather than of, say, countries, politics and policies. So, the drug lord is bad, as are at least some on the police force in South Americaville. Santiago and his United States cohort, by contrast, are good and unfailingly patriotic, yet they’re also struggling back home in the civilian world. Tom (Ben Affleck) is a commander turned failing real estate agent in dad pants; the sensitive Ben (Garrett Hedlund) gets smacked around in wrestling cages. After the slamming opener, the movie’s worldview becomes clearer. Santiago seems to be some kind of freelance military adviser for the South Americaville police (or military, whatever). The title refers to the border shared by Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay; I believe there’s a border sign for Brazil in one scene. But the country is really just an attractive, putatively exotic backdrop and as generic as it is in most mindless action blowouts. The difference is that this movie tries to rationalize both its violence and its characters’ behavior, which shifts dramatically when Santiago suggests that he and his buddies rob the drug lord, who’s bunkered in an Amazonian Fort Knox. Chandor handles the action scenes smoothly, making it easy to gloss over what the movie is saying, trying to say or accidentally saying. He maintains the kind of accelerated pace that gives your eyes a workout, and pads the story with an inviting camaraderie that brings you into the group. He also lays on texturizing details, like the Glock pistol logo worn by William (Charlie Hunnam), another member of this soulful brotherhood. Pedro Pascal plays the fifth member, the helicopter pilot tasked with the getaway, so all in all they’re fairly irresistible. And then Santiago appeals to their avarice, souring things. After fighting for the flag for years, he says, they have “nothing to show for it.” The other guys react with the requisite hemming and hawing; someone probably scuffs his boot in the dirt. These are, after all, honorable men, or so the movie repeatedly insists, despite the mounting evidence to the contrary. (They’re thieves.) Working from a script that he rewrote, Chandor struggles to make the story’s contradictions gel. They never do. (The original is by Mark Boal, who’s best known for his collaborations with Kathryn Bigelow.) That’s the case even when the other unsurprising villain emerges, its entrance underscored by Bob Dylan’s Vietnam-era song “Masters of War” that revs up on the soundtrack to point a singular damning finger: “You put a gun in my hand.”"
29,Captain Marvel,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/movies/captain-marvel-review.html,"One thing we learn in “Captain Marvel” is that it’s pronounced MarVELL, like the English poet — or at least it used to be, on distant planets and right here on Earth, a windy rock also known as C-53. That was back in 1995, when most of this movie takes place and when the world as we know it had not yet been colonized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, of course, Marvel Comics had been around for decades, but when the heroine crashes through the roof of the Blockbuster Video store, landing in between the “Family” and “Drama” sections, there are no Avengers or Iron-Man titles on the shelves. Instead, she picks up a VHS box of “The Right Stuff,” which earns a mild chuckle, since while we know that she’s a space alien named Vers (rhymes with “cheers”), we also have reason to suspect that this young woman is connected with the United States Air Force, and maybe the space program, too, like the guys in that film. Also known as Carol Danvers, and played by Brie Larson, she has some of their bravado, and also — since she’s on the way to intergalactic superheroism — a righteous sense of mission and a burgeoning identity crisis. [Captain Marvel has had many, many identities in the comics.] The last and least surprising thing we learn about her is that “Captain Marvel will return in ‘Avengers: Endgame,’” a scrappy little picture that will be released in seven weeks, if you can stand to wait that long. Directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck from a script they wrote with Geneva Robertson-Dworet, “Captain Marvel” is an origin story, which is to say a résumé check for the newest member of popular culture’s biggest, most heavily capitalized corporate team. As such, it’s pretty good fun, and could almost be described without sarcasm as a scrappy little picture, like most of Boden and Fleck’s other work. (Their résumé includes “Half Nelson,"" “Sugar” and “It’s Kind of a Funny Story”). It’s not too long, not too self-important, and benefits from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening, Jude Law and Ben Mendelsohn. And of course Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a young, two-eyed S.H.I.E.L.D. agent named Nicholas Fury. How Fury lost one of those eyes is the big spoiler to avoid here, and the character’s extended presence, after so many agitated cameos over the years, is a big part of the movie’s appeal. To watch the digitally rejuvenated Jackson riding around mid-90s Los Angeles, sort of like he did in “Pulp Fiction,” is to indulge in a bit of Gen-X nostalgia, a mood augmented by period-appropriate musical cues from Salt-N-Pepa, TLC and Nirvana. [Can ‘Captain Marvel’ fix Marvel’s woman problem?] There are pay phones and pagers, too, and boxy government cars and all kinds of stuff that kids these days just don’t appreciate. Even the science-fiction elements have a mildly retro, “Star Trek: The Next Generation” feel. And the overall vibe, for all the fireballs and fisticuffs, is decidedly friendly. In addition to the Vers/Fury buddy-movie pairing, there is a best friend for Carol (a fellow pilot named Maria Rambeau, played by Lashana Lynch) and a succession of frenemies. Best of all, there is an orange cat. I will never hate a movie with an orange cat. The plot of “Captain Marvel,” for some reason, is another secret I’m supposed to keep. Which is fine. In spite of what some unhinged fans on social media might say, I was not paid by Disney to explain anything. Boden and Fleck were, and they do a perfectly adequate job. There’s a big war going on between the Kree — Vers’s people, at least as far as she knows — and the Skrull, green-skinned, pointy-eared beings who have the unnerving skill of turning into doppelgängers of anyone they see. Annette Bening is involved. We first see her as a manifestation of Supreme Intelligence, which seems accurate enough. I’ll say no more. The twists in the story reveal a slyly anti-imperialist politics, which is both in keeping with the pluralist ethic of the Avengers cycle and just a bit subversive of the Disney-Marvel agenda of universal domination. The most sympathetic group of characters wants nothing more than to go somewhere else, to escape from the annihilating attention of their would-be conquerors. They might represent various oppressed and dispossessed earthly populations. They might also stand in for that portion of the movie audience that feels the cinematic universe shrinking around them. Not that anyone can stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe from expanding. By now the contradictions of this gigantic enterprise are obvious enough. It’s inclusive and monopolistic, predatory and empowering. Every episode is unique — every hero is a complex individual with a singular back story — within an overall structure of sameness. Filmmakers like Boden and Fleck, Ryan Coogler and Taika Waititi can put their own spin on a given story or hero, but at some point bolts or waves of orange or blue light will come shooting out of someone’s hands and someone else will be thrown backward and bounce off a wall. The protagonist’s costume will become a character in its own right. That protagonist — a tough and charming woman, in this case, determined to fight gender clichés at least to a draw — will be ready for a career of franchise clock-punching, along with the rest of us. You will stay through the very last credits in the hope of collecting every last Easter egg, and you’ll shuffle out of the theater feeling both satisfied and empty."
30,The Kid,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/movies/the-kid-review.html,"Starting as violently as it plans to continue, Vincent D’Onofrio’s “The Kid” drops us into a savage altercation as Rio (Jake Schur), 13, kills his abusive father before slicing the face of his scummy uncle, Grant (Chris Pratt). Primed by the boy’s affectless narration (here, when characters aren’t practicing brutality, they’re talking about it), we intuit that what will follow for Rio and his older sister, Sara (Leila George), is unlikely to be pretty. Set in the American Southwest in 1879, “The Kid” feels less like an actual movie than a table-napkin idea for one. A fateful encounter with Billy the Kid (Dane DeHaan) and his nemesis, Sheriff Pat Garrett (Ethan Hawke), lands the siblings in Santa Fe and back in Grant’s clutches. For Sara, that means the brothel, where Grant seemingly has a season pass; for Rio, it means deciding which of his two new acquaintances he can trust to rescue her. Having set up a lofty coming-of-age choice between good and evil, Andrew Lanham’s screenplay — as fuzzy as the legend from which it sprouts — caves beneath unlikely coincidences and well-worn stereotypes. Sturdier by far is Matthew J. Lloyd’s painterly photography: though at times squintingly dark, his New Mexico scrub and skylines are distractingly pleasing. While marquee names wrestle with characters as insubstantial as holograms, Lloyd gives us a reason to keep watching. Lacking a robust narrative, D’Onofrio desperately spackles over gaps with hackneyed close-ups of faces well versed in romancing a camera. “I don’t know where the good in you two comes from,” Garrett tells Rio and Sara at one point. “But I know there’s plenty of it.” He must know a lot more than we do, then."
31,Wonder Park,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/movies/wonder-park-review.html,"In the amiable animated feature “Wonder Park,” a child’s imagination can power an amusement park. Unfortunately, the movie falls shy of providing the same sensory thrill ride. June (voiced by Brianna Denski) is an 8-year-old who displays an unusual aptitude for engineering. She’s developed her talent through conversations with her mother (voiced by Jennifer Garner), who talks June through her plans for a park called Wonderland, where animals run the rides and carousels are mounted with fish that really fly. But when her mother falls ill, June abandons the blueprints for her park, trading her imagination for worry. Having abandoned her daydreams, June is shocked when she wanders into the woods after escaping a trip to camp and finds Wonderland fully realized. The park is now haunted by a dark vortex that has damaged the rides. With the help of her park’s animal crew, June must conjure up solutions to fix the damage. “Wonder Park” thrives when it emphasizes the practical pleasures of creativity. The movie visualizes the gears and pulleys of June’s creations, producing exciting action scenes that make fantasies function efficiently. (Its uncredited director, Dylan Brown, was removed from the film after allegations surfaced of what The Hollywood Reporter and other outlets described as “inappropriate and unwanted conduct.” Brown disputed the allegations.) But when these sequences fall back to accommodate the narrative, the shabbiness of the visual design drains energy from the screen. The characters are unexpressive and generic, making it difficult to connect to their emotions, and murky colors dim the fantasy. Although its protagonist is blessed with a gift for engineering the impossible, “Wonder Park” is a film where faulty execution betrays a healthy imagination."
34,The Aftermath,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/movies/the-aftermath-review.html,"“The Aftermath” opens in 1945 and could easily have been made then, too. An old-fashioned wartime romance whose plot highlights are recognizable from outer space, this gleaming dollop of prestige comfort food is neither logically coherent nor emotionally satisfying. It is, though, stunningly pretty as Rachael (Keira Knightley), a resentful British Army wife, arrives in bombed-out Hamburg to join her high-ranking husband, Lewis (Jason Clarke). “It’s chaos out there,” Lewis remarks as they drive through perfectly scattered rubble, yet this stolid, stagy movie transmits no sense of destabilization. As if to remedy that, we meet Stephan (Alexander Skarsgard, resplendent in a series of snazzy woolen jumpers), the lonesome German widower whose luxurious home Lewis has requisitioned. Stephan and his troubled daughter (Flora Thiemann) might have obligingly moved into the attic, but that won’t stop him from doing some requisitioning of his own. Few can smolder like Skarsgard, yet his inevitable affair with Rachael has little heat. Each has a heartbreaking reason to distrust the other; but instead of exploring the wary psychological dance between victor and vanquished, grief and acceptance, the director, James Kent (working from Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse’s adaptation of Rhidian Brook’s 2013 novel), leaps from hostility to adultery with preposterous speed. While the cinematographer, Franz Lustig, conjures gauzy flashbacks and glowing glamour shots, promising subplots — like Stephan’s possibly murky past and his daughter’s dalliance with a dangerous young Hitler sympathizer — are hastily snuffed out. Had Kent (who excelled in 2015 with the World War I drama “Testament of Youth”) diverted a fraction of the cost of his lavish production design to beefing up the screenplay, this corny melodrama might have had a chance of pleasing our minds as much as our eyes."
35,Five Feet Apart,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/movies/five-feet-apart-review.html,"In “Five Feet Apart,” Stella (Haley Lu Richardson) is a teenager with cystic fibrosis. Will (Cole Sprouse), a newcomer to the hospital where she resides, also has the disease and is undergoing a drug trial for an antibiotic-resistant infection. They don’t mesh, at first. She is obsessive-compulsive and effusive; she dutifully takes her meds and keeps a YouTube diary about her life. He is a brooding artist and rule-breaker convinced that they are breathing borrowed air. Because of the risk of cross-infection, they must stay six feet apart. Five feet, as measured by the pool cue they carry between them, will be their eventual concession to love and living dangerously. Promoted by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as an awareness tool, “Five Feet Apart” is better made than a synopsis suggests. To maintain the illusion of intimacy, the director, Justin Baldoni, plays tricks with focal lengths, often framing Richardson and Sprouse so that they appear close together before cutting to a wide shot that shows them far apart. Richardson, previously wonderful with good material (“Columbus,” “Support the Girls”), here cements her genius status by finding depths beyond the contrived screenplay. The cast’s schlock redemption efforts only go so far in a story that stacks the deck with a tragedy in Stella’s family and a series of increasingly implausible rendezvous between Stella and Will. You can set your watch to what happens to Stella’s best friend (Moises Arias), also a patient, and the last act is a supernova of shamelessness. But even then, this weepie is tough to resist entirely."
36,The Highwaymen,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/movies/the-highwaymen-review.html,"To call “The Highwaymen” revisionist — or even reactionary — would be an understatement. This retelling of the Bonnie and Clyde story is not content to posit that those two Depression-era outlaws got what they deserved when they died in a hail of bullets on a Louisiana back road. It has a sackful of bones to pick with the modern world as a whole. Violent criminals are a problem, yes, but so are movies, airplanes, car radios, women in politics, newspapers — you name it. If Grandpa Simpson could figure out how to get himself a Netflix subscription, this movie would be the whole algorithm. I’m here to say I didn’t entirely hate it. As Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow rampage across a half-dozen states, the governor of Texas, Miriam “Ma” Ferguson (Kathy Bates), is persuaded by her head law enforcement honcho, Lee Simmons (John Carroll Lynch), to bring a couple of old Texas Rangers out of retirement. The governor has disbanded the Rangers and brags about raising taxes to replace them with a more up-to-date police force. J. Edgar Hoover is doing the same thing at the federal level, and while we never see Hoover’s face we do hear him called a “high-flying sissy” by one of our heroes. Hoover’s men are smug, citified so-and-sos in trim suits who set great store by fancy crime-fighting techniques like fingerprint analysis, wiretaps, two-way radios and aerial surveillance. The ex-Rangers, reclassified as highway patrolmen for their new mission, prefer to rely on horse sense and cowboy folk wisdom. “Outlaws and mustangs always come home,” says Frank Hamer (Kevin Costner), the older, gruffer one. He reckons that Bonnie and Clyde will circle back to the Dallas neighborhood where they grew up. He’s mostly right, but the feds and other busybodies keep getting in the way. The plan is not to take the fugitives alive. Before he sets out in pursuit — and before he’s joined by his erstwhile partner, Maney Gault (Woody Harrelson) — Frank purchases a small arsenal at a Lubbock gun shop. Even though he’s a bit rusty on the draw, Frank is a professional, and he takes the job personally. Barrow and Parker’s slaughter of police officers enrages him, and he’s disgusted by the aura of Robin Hood chic that has gathered around them. Graffiti on a rural water tower reads “Go Bonnie and Clyde!” Young women sport berets in imitation of Bonnie’s signature look. “Coldblooded killers who are more adored than movie stars” is Lee Simmons’s assessment. Directed by John Lee Hancock (“The Blind Side”) from a script by John Fusco, “The Highwaymen” offers itself as a corrective to one of the most famous — and in its day controversial — products of 1960s Hollywood. “Bonnie and Clyde” magnified the mystique of ’30s bank robbers by refracting it through the lens of counterculture revolt. This movie opposes that one with every fiber of its ornery being, including by its insistence on procedural tedium over cinematic excitement. It’s no less violent than “Bonnie and Clyde,” but it’s in a much worse mood. “They aren’t human anymore,” Frank says, referring to the gun-crazy kids he’s determined to bring down. The filmmakers support this thesis by keeping Bonnie and Clyde’s faces offscreen until the very end. They’re meant to be monsters, but also ciphers and symbols of a world gone wrong. Frank and Maney carry their own share of metaphorical baggage. American movies vacillate endlessly between the worship of lawmen and the romance of outlaws, but few are as dogmatically one-sided as this one. With all respect to Harrelson and Costner, they aren’t about to compete with 1967-vintage Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty in the sex-appeal department. Hancock compensates by eliminating sex appeal altogether, replacing it with stubborn, grouchy belligerence. This can be kind of touching — the spectacle of old guys muttering and wheezing can have that effect — and kind of fun, too. Frank, superfluously described as a “grump” by one of his wife’s genteel friends, lives in comfortable retirement with said wife (Kim Dickens, too briefly) and his pet javelina. Maney has it rougher, living in a shack on foreclosed land with his daughter and her family, with no job and a taste for liquor. He’s the drinker. Frank, a crumpled pack of Luckies in his shirt pocket, is the smoker. Frank is the alpha: stern in his morality, steady in his judgment, slow to smile. Maney is the sidekick: jokey, annoying, troubled by his conscience and haunted by the memory of men he has killed. He doesn’t like the idea of shooting a woman, or gunning down a man without warning. His sensitivity provides a foil for Frank’s unbending righteousness, and also an alibi for bleeding-heart viewers who might find themselves enjoying this tale of rough justice in spite of themselves. Costner and Harrelson generally give pretty good value. This isn’t an especially good movie — it’s too long, too drenched in Thomas Newman’s cloyingly eclectic score, too full of speechifying and self-regard — but it is a coherent one, with the courage of its vengeful, murderous, politically terrifying convictions."
40,Us,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/movies/earth-review.html,"The day after I watched the documentary “Earth,” I spent time working in my garden, digging, planting, getting my hands dirty. I didn’t grow up gardening and I’m not especially good at it. Even so, when I’m not inadvertently killing plants, I find it satisfying tending the yard. It’s a small pleasure, though given what the domination of nature has wrought, also a paradoxical one. More than 12 million acres have burned in Australia as of this week and, as this movie reminds you, there is no escaping complicity in what the environmentalist Bill McKibben has called “the end of nature.” While gardening, I kept thinking about “Earth,” which offers a look at how humans — by excavating, by tunneling, by fetishizing Carrara marble countertops — are changing material existence. The displacement of earth in the documentary is on a far larger, more dramatic scale than what any casual gardener does, true, but the movie is a stark reminder that someone, at some point, cleared and gouged the land to build that gardener’s house, streets and city. This isn’t news, but it is still sobering to see the planet ruined one backhoe at a time. The movie opens with a fixed, perfectly framed shot of a dun-colored, gently sloping terrain. The place is somewhere in the San Fernando Valley, a huge swath just north of the Los Angeles basin. Centuries ago, the area was a prairie alive with people, flora and fauna, including the now-extinct California grizzly. Over time, much of this life was supplanted by non-native settlers, livestock, citrus groves, film studios, tract housing and that pop-culture cliché called the Valley Girl. In “Earth,” the area’s continued expansion is bleakly expressed by a parade of bulldozers and backhoes that, from a distance, appear to be engaged in a perverse, choreographed dance. The men operating those machines are cutting mountains for a development, which is as mesmerizing to watch as it is appalling to think about. You grasp the enormous scale of this project from the long shots that the director Nikolaus Geyrhalter (“Our Daily Bread”) liberally uses. These shots tend either to render people invisible (when inside the machines they operate) or to turn them into undifferentiated specks. There’s a strangely paradoxical and dystopian quality to these visions, which are at once wholly human and inhuman. If this were science fiction, you could say the machines had already risen, which would be almost reassuring in its nihilistic finality. Geyrhalter’s filmmaking is cool, measured and almost clinical. Serving as his own cinematographer, he gives the movie pictorial grace and balance (his framing is impeccable) but not too much beauty, as is appropriate given the material. You marvel at, and think about, the sites instead of the virtuosity of his filmmaking, and listen to the people he interviews, what they say and what they pointedly don’t. Here and there — in a Spanish copper mine, an Austrian tunnel, an Italian quarry — earth moving, digging and drilling is taking place on a staggering scale. It’s altering the planet’s crust, that thin outermost layer which constitutes about 1 percent of its volume. Geyrhalter introduces each of the seven sites in the movie with an overhead shot, the kind that’s often called a bird’s-eye (or God’s-eye) view but is now more associated with Google Earth. This shift in how we describe our world (from birds to software) is itself instructive. “Earth” belongs to an unsettling group of movies about the Anthropocene, a classification that’s used to distinguish our human-influenced geological epoch. In 2000, the scientists Paul J. Crutzen and Eugene F. Stoermer traced the start of this new era to the latter part of the 18th century, noting the ravages that have come since: a human population explosion, species extinctions, greenhouse gases and all the grim rest. “Without major catastrophes like an enormous volcanic eruption,” Crutzen and Stoermer wrote, “mankind will remain a major geological force for many millennia, maybe millions of years, to come.” You would think from this diagnosis and from everything in “Earth,” with its eerily ravaged landscapes, that Geyrhalter’s documentary would be too painful to watch. And it can be tough going. Yet, despite its apocalyptic visions, it feels curiously optimistic because Geyrhalter hasn’t given up on us. It would have been easy to rile us up, to exploit our tears and fears. But only an idealist treats his audience with as much respect as he does here. And only an idealist invites his audience to look at the world as closely and deeply as he does as he reminds us that it is only by seeing — really seeing — the world as it exists, that we stand any chance at all of saving it. Earth Not rated. In German, English, Spanish, Hungarian and Italian, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 55 minutes."
41,Hotel Mumbai,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/movies/hotel-mumbai-review.html,"Like “United 93,” “Hotel Mumbai” begins from the uncomfortable premise of turning an actual terrorist incident into material for a dramatized suspense feature. In November 2008, 10 men unleashed gunfire and grenade assaults across Mumbai, killing more than 160 people. The film, inspired by a documentary, “Surviving Mumbai,” relays these events from the vantage points of a sprawling international ensemble. The characters, many of them composites, are the guests and staff members of the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower Hotel, one of two luxury hotels the terrorists targeted, and where more than 30 died during the siege. An affluent couple (Nazanin Boniadi and Armie Hammer) leave their newborn upstairs with the nanny (Tilda Cobham-Hervey) to enjoy their dinner date in the hotel restaurant. A high-rolling Russian (Jason Isaacs) plans to spend the evening cavorting with local escorts. The heroic hotel employees include the head chef (Anupam Kher) and a Sikh waiter (Dev Patel) who shows up to work that day without proper footwear but begs to stay, needing the shift. Anthony Maras, making his first feature, interweaves these threads with precision and clarity, conveying an impressive sense of the hotel layout, the confusion of the circumstances and the visceral fear of hiding from the gunmen. (The opulent hotel was re-created in both Mumbai and Adelaide, Australia.) But the more involving “Hotel Mumbai” plays in the moment, the queasier it seems in retrospect. It reduces the randomness of real-life bloodshed to the slick thrills of a popcorn movie. And after the mosque attacks in Christchurch, which led the film’s distributor in New Zealand to suspend the movie’s release there, its savagery is especially difficult to take."
42,The Dirt,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/movies/the-dirt-review.html,"Mötley Crüe’s first gig, as dramatized in Jeff Tremaine’s Netflix adaptation of the band’s memoir, “The Dirt,” does not go well. The drummer, Tommy Lee, knocks over a cymbal before anyone plays a note; the crowd’s heckling turns into a full-on brawl. But when that fight is over, a guy in the back punctures the silence to scream, “[Expletive] yeah, Mötley Crüe!” And that sentiment is an apt summation of the approach and complexity of this tepid, incompetent biopic. The book version, attributed to all four members and the writer Neil Strauss, was a notorious tell-all, reveling in the group’s bad behavior and self-mythologizing. But Tremaine and the screenwriters Rich Wilkes and Amanda Adelson have sanded it down to a junior varsity “Bohemian Rhapsody,” complete with many of the same crude devices: embarrassingly bad wigs, hilariously on-the-nose needle drops (the band plays “Take Me to the Top” as they go … to the top) and declamatory, subtext-free dialogue. As with “Bohemian,” the result is the kind of paint-by-numbers storytelling that “Walk Hard” should have smothered in its crib over a decade ago. Tremaine’s staging is as convincing as an ’80s-themed party at an insurance office, and the film is shot with all the visual punch of a period Bud Light commercial. The nonstop preening and partying of the first half is exhausting, but the comedown, in which Tremaine attempts to rearrange the film into a serious character drama, is downright painful. The filmmakers try desperately to have it both ways, flipping from cheerful hedonism to “Reefer Madness”-style moralizing. The complexities of addiction seems out of their grasp. Biopics love to dazzle us with their try-hard verisimilitude, and this one gives us nearly 10 minutes of end-credit split-screen comparisons between the real Crüe and the movie Crüe, presumably so we can marvel at the skill of the duplication. But that’s cosplay, not moviemaking. Until then, “The Dirt” plays like an ill-advised remake of “This Is Spinal Tap” — one in which all the laughs are unintentional."
43,Dumbo,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/movies/dumbo-review.html,"In his live-action remake of Disney’s “Dumbo,” Tim Burton plays with a legacy that he has helped burnish for decades, only to set it gleefully ablaze. Ho-hum until it takes a turn toward the fascinatingly weird, the movie is a welcome declaration of artistic independence for Burton, who often strains against aesthetic and industrial restrictions. Watching him cut loose (more recklessly than his flying baby elephant) is by far the most unexpected pleasure of this movie, which dusts off the 1941 animated charmer with exhilaratingly demented spirit. One of Disney’s simplest, sweetest heart-tuggers (with some queasy racial stereotypes), the original “Dumbo” tells the story of a wee circus elephant whose enormous flappy ears enable him to fly. Based on a children’s book, it was made fast and proved a terrific success. The straightforward story might not have seemed an obvious choice for an auteurist project, particularly given this one’s cultivated eccentricities. But “Dumbo” is among the seemingly endless number of animated movies that Disney is giving a live-action makeover: “Jungle Book,” “The Lion King,” “Aladdin,” “Mulan,” “The Sword in the Stone,” and on and on until the end of the world (or movies) as we know it. For roughly the first half-hour of the new “Dumbo,” Burton seems on autopilot as he introduces the characters and sets the old-timey scene with an otherworldly pale palette. (The script is by Ehren Kruger, whose credits include “The Brothers Grimm” and several “Transformers” movies.) The story opens in 1919 at a down-and-out circus owned by Max Medici (Danny DeVito, pumping life into his scenes), a ringmaster who presides over the movie’s busily milling, child-friendly freaks and geeks. By the time an earnest, tamped-down Colin Farrell enters as Holt, a big-tent trick rider turned disabled World War I veteran, the near two-hour running time feels a lot like a threat. [Need help deciding what movies or TV shows to stream next? Subscribe to our Watching newsletter.] Things pick up when baby Dumbo arrives in a makeshift birthing bed. Now a digital cutie with gargantuan ears that hang off each side of his head like heavy leather curtains, the newest, littlest circus addition is conspicuously more animal than his childlike antecedent. Like the original, this Dumbo doesn’t speak, which perhaps is why Burton focuses on his unnaturally large, expressive eyes. (He’s an Indian elephant, so his trunk has one searching finger.) Those eyes moisten a lot, including when Holt’s drearily conceptualized and motherless — of course! — children (Nico Parker and Finley Hobbins) comfort Dumbo after his protective mom is sent to elephant jail. In time, the kids help teach Dumbo to fly, coaxing him with a feather he snuffles into his trunk: He sneezes, and the exhalation sends him up. When he finally achieves genuine liftoff, soaring around the interior of the circus’s one-ring tent, Burton does, too. It’s ticklish fun to watch baby elephants of any kind, including an airborne one. That’s true even if Dumbo’s flights prove increasingly bleak because he’s at the mercy of some very bad people. Humans are secondary attractions in the 1941 movie (its animals are people proxies) but they crowd the remake. Most are just generic placeholders, but a few are strikingly brutal exploiters, none more so than V. A. Vandevere, a subversive invention. Played by Michael Keaton in full live-wire mode, Vandevere is a stereotypical Richie Rich screen villain with a shadowy lair; dark designs; a wolfish smile; and a silky, possibly fatal femme, Colette (Eva Green, who adds some steel filament to a bauble). Keaton makes the character more memorable than most anyone here; Vandevere seems ready to dangerously pop. What makes him particularly arresting, though, is that he owns a sprawling, impersonal amusement park named Dreamland that is filled with menace and with attractions — Nightmare Island, Wonders of Science, Rocket to the Future and the ominously named Colosseum — that suggest a Disneyland Bizarro World. At first, Dreamland seems like just another reflexive flourish in a film about a group of ragtag struggling entertainers rescued by a star. There are a lot of movies about movies, and the default is generally self-flattering even at its most cynical. Disney’s have long been de facto advertisements for the company’s even more profitable offscreen world; its animated “Hercules” actually features a Hercules Store with merch that mirrors the stuff sold offscreen. In “Dumbo,” Burton takes this self-referential impulse to a startling level through the representation of its Walt Disney-style impresario — who speaks of magic and mystique — and then by lighting the whole shebang on fire. By the time Holt is galloping through flames and Vandevere is threatening to kill Dumbo’s mom — matricide being a studio signature — the movie has gone enjoyably bonkers. The animals are roaring, the workers are revolting, and Burton has merrily turned what could have been another remake into something genuinely different and surprising. What exactly it is will partly depend on your view toward Disney. So it’s worth noting that for all the tumult and fury, this can also feel a bit like a bittersweet origin story: 1919 was the same year that the teenage Walt returned from war and was hired by a commercial art shop where he met Ub Iwerks, who helped create Mickey Mouse. “They’re paying me to draw pictures,” Walt said, voicing the joy of creation that is too often missing in his company’s later movies but here burns with a vengeance."
44,The Beach Bum,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/movies/the-beach-bum-review.html,"“That’s great poetry,” Moondog says near the end of “The Beach Bum,” delivering a verdict on his own work. A bit later, after a literally explosive bacchanal during which bales of cash and a sailboat are set alight, he declares the evening “a blast,” inserting an expletive for emphasis. Those two statements pretty much sum up what this movie, the latest from Harmony Korine, thinks of itself. Chronicling a hectic season in the life of its hero (a defiantly unkempt Matthew McConaughey), “The Beach Bum” is intoxicated by its own shaggy lyricism and committed to an ethic of unapologetic hedonism. Moondog is a genius. He will be the first to tell you so, but everyone else is quick to agree: his wife, Minnie (Isla Fisher); their daughter, Heather (Stefania LaVie Owen); Moondog’s agent (Jonah Hill, doing an accent somewhere between Truman Capote and Foghorn Leghorn); the judge (Jo Marie Payton) who sends the poet off to rehab. Moondog quotes D.H. Lawrence and Charles Baudelaire from memory, so there’s nothing wrong with his taste. Twice he shares a verse of his own, a brief paean to his penis. He takes the stage at bars and parties in Key West and other parts of South Florida, reciting off-the-cuff odes that, if you were drunk enough, might put you in mind of Walt Whitman, Allen Ginsberg or maybe Henry Miller. Even with all the tequila in Margaritaville, I will never be that drunk. Speaking of which, Jimmy Buffett is in this movie, playing himself. Snoop Dogg is in it, too, as Moondog’s drug-dealer best friend, Ray (short for Lingerie), and the high point comes when the two musicians collaborate on an impromptu ballad in Moondog’s honor. There is some other fun stuff, too — beautiful shots of the evening sky over Miami; good-time music that takes you back to the ’70s and ’80s; Zac Efron and Martin Lawrence in manic cameos — but nobody sitting in the theater or on the couch will experience as much pleasure as the people onscreen. Available evidence suggests that the movie was a total blast to make. One of Korine’s distinctions as a filmmaker is his total commitment to his characters. He does not judge, scold or moralize, but follows the misfit children of his imagination as far beyond respectability as they will take him. Sometimes this is repellent, sometimes provocative, sometimes even — in “Spring Breakers,” at least — profound. “The Beach Bum” is none of these. Its soul is sentimental, conventional and timid in spite of its hero’s bravado. Moondog may seem like a fearless free spirit, but the movie he lives in is as risk averse and conflict avoidant as a toddler’s bedtime story. Like a toddler, Moondog — whose Hawaiian-print suits look like pajamas accessorized with a diaper-like fanny pack — is a creature of pure narcissistic impulse. He will never say no to a drink, a joint, a line of cocaine or a sexually available woman, and nobody ever says no to him either. Some things happen that might, in other circumstances, put a damper on the good times. Minnie is having an affair with Ray. Heather is getting married. Someone close to Moondog dies, and he is sent off to rehab. Also, an enormous inheritance is held in escrow until Moondog finishes his next masterpiece. None of this changes anything. It’s not that Moondog overcomes adversity. Adversity doesn’t exist in his universe. Korine’s loyalty to the character — his protective impulse to shield Moondog from any criticism — is so intense that any hint that his behavior might have troubling implications is banished from consideration. The only person who doesn’t like Moondog is Heather’s fiancé (Joshua Ritter), who is given a demeaning nickname and branded as a hopeless square. But without anyone or anything to rebel against, Moondog turns into a bore. McConaughey, for his part, tries to locate the limit of his charm and succeeds much too quickly. Wonderful though it is to see him with a white kitten, in homage to Anita Ekberg in “La Dolce Vita,” it is less enchanting to be subjected to his gales of forced laughter. At least we can’t smell Moondog’s breath, or see what he is composing on his portable typewriter. But it’s hard to miss the stale air that surrounds him. What “The Beach Bum” celebrates as transgression is pure tedium. What it takes for divine lunacy is frat house doggerel. The booze flows freely. The women are topless and ornamental. The cars and boats are fast and expensive. There’s nothing much worth writing about."
46,Shazam!,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/movies/shazam-review.html,"Ever since Christopher Nolan took Batman to their mutually productive dark place, the DC cinematic super-universe has been as somber as a grave. There have been exceptions, shimmers of light amid the doom. Outside the animated realm, though, the stories and mood have been downbeat, matched by hues that range from drab to black amid bilious green, raging purple and watery blue. Even the “S” on Superman’s chest looks drained of cheer, more like dried blood than some candy-colored delight. Given this, the bright, popping red of the superhero costume in “Shazam!” is an early warning sign, as obvious as a matador’s cape, that the dreary and crepuscular have given way to something less self-serious and end-of-the-world grim. It’s a nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic, if not a revolutionary shift. There are still a lot of brand shilling and the usual tediously overextended fights, ka-pow and ka-boom. But these are delivered via Shazam, a charmingly breezy avenger in tights once known as Captain Marvel, a.k.a. the World’s Mightiest Mortal, or as I thought of him going in: Who? The answer emerges piecemeal in “Shazam!,” another movie about a superhero with dual-identity issues. Here, the divided self begins with Billy (Asher Angel, a relaxed, natural presence), a foundling with pluck, heart and a sob story. He’s on a mission to find his mother (longish story), a journey that — as sometimes happens in male quests — leads him to a surrogate father. This one is an ancient wizard called, ta-da, Wizard (Djimon Hounsou in a comic Halloween-ish get-up), who passes his magic to Billy. Once back in his normal realm, Billy discovers that he can tap great powers by saying the word “shazam,” which turns him into a hero with an adult body (Zachary Levi). If this sounds familiar — the Moses-like savior who learns he’s meant for greatness — it’s because the character was conceived to compete with Superman. Yet because Shazam isn’t as well known as Supes et al., he’s not as weighed down with fan expectations, the fate of the world and auteurist aspirations. The filmmakers (Henry Gayden wrote the script, David F. Sandberg directed) adhere to the heroic template, which means there’s a regulation villain (the reliably watchable Mark Strong) with schemes. But they also fill in the faces and places, and add enough shading and color to Billy’s world that when his inevitable fight against evil happens it feels as if something more than the box office is at stake. Of course a franchise may be at stake, though considering how often the movie name drops Batman and Superman, it can’t help but feel as if the entire DC movie world is on the line. And maybe Shazam is a risk, just because he’s an unfamiliar avenger in a wildly overcrowded field. Created in 1939, the character was originally called Captain Marvel (and physically modeled on the actor Fred MacMurray). But for legal reasons, Captain Marvel went into storage only to be later resurrected by DC as Shazam. (DC’s longtime foe, Marvel Comics, managed to trademark the character’s first name for the avenger currently played by Brie Larson in “Captain Marvel.”) The new movie quickly dusts off the Shazam story, first by grounding it in Billy, a sweet, if somewhat melancholic mischief maker who soon becomes an appealing protagonist. The opening scene involving a couple of dimwit cops feels as ancient as a Bowery Boys movie, perhaps intentionally. Things soon settle into an easy, everyday groove when Billy moves into a new foster home, a sprawl populated by kids (Jack Dylan Grazer, among them) who are generally cute instead of cutesy. Tenderly overseen by Rosa and Victor (Marta Milans and Cooper Andrews), the house has a lived-in coziness, a warmth and security that feels as unforced as the mix of ethnicities and races. Once Billy says that magic word and his supersized alter ego appears, the movie goes to its happy place and comfortably embraces its own identity as a light, jocular, modest entertainment. Levi is best known for his television roles (“Chuck,” “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”), but he easily scales up for the big screen. He can look like a beefier, tougher John Krasinski; as Shazam, though, Levi is pure cartoon, from his bootblacked helmet of hair to his tumescent musculature. Ken-doll plastic and handsome, he is an ideal, suitably absurd figure on which to hang an old-fashioned hero with a satiny high-collared cape and a fat yellow arrow suggestively pointing down. The arrow is a winking joke and as subtle as the nod to the Tom Hanks body-swapping comedy “Big.” It’s also a reminder of Billy’s larger human journey, a metamorphosis that remains humorously, identifiably awkward, even as he wills his inner super-adult to heroic life. Angel’s performance lays the groundwork for the character — and keeps him tethered to reality — while Levi lifts Shazam up with an exuberant turn that conveys the delight of Billy’s extreme transformation as well as its lingering adolescent ungainliness and excess. It’s one thing to fight evil, but Shazam’s eye-popping, slack-jawed, discordant physicality is a reminder that it’s just as tough to get a grip on yourself."
47,Pet Sematary,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/pet-sematary-review.html,"Stephen King is so monumentally productive, even now, five decades into his career, that it’s hard to nail down the peaks of his bibliography. But critics and fans agree that his 1983 novel “Pet Sematary” was something special, and especially horrific. The story of an attractive American family finding terror in a new home credibly wedded Edgar Allan Poe’s twitchy, stiff-necked dread with the fetid, swampy atmospherics of a 1950s EC horror comic. The Creeds, Louis and Rachel and their young children, Ellie and Gage, move to rustic Maine and find out their property includes a creepy burial ground for pets, and behind that, an even creepier burial ground where the loved ones interred “come back,” as the Creeds’s avuncular neighbor, Jud, puts it. Louis and Jud try it out on the family’s killed-by-a-truck cat. That doesn’t work out well. Then other things don’t work out well. King’s novel was adapted for the screen in 1989. Directed by Mary Lambert, that “Pet Sematary” was a squirrelly, wild-eyed movie. This version is more Hollywood smooth. It’s very well-acted by Jason Clarke, Amy Seimetz, John Lithgow and especially Jeté Laurence as young Ellie. Directors Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer, showing puzzling distrust of their strong source material, overload the movie with arbitrary jump scares. And they replace King’s despairing, tragic denouement with something altogether more glib. But when they settle into a groove that aligns with the novel’s, the movie delivers great unsettling jolts that approximate the power of King’s vision. I also appreciate the respect and good taste of the filmmakers’ choice of closing song, a blistering Starcrawler cover of the Ramones’s theme from the original movie."
49,High Life,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/high-life-review.html,"Every so often in “High Life,” the latest from the French director Claire Denis, there’s a shot of outer space. A cosmic whatsit, the story largely takes place in a black-velvet void with pinpricks of light. Earth is far away, long ago, a memory. Not all that much happens in this immensity, though sometimes a colorful gassy emanation floods the screen and something — a wrench, a body — floats into the great nothing. Inside a spaceship, by contrast, there’s plenty of action: bodily fluids, spasms of violence, the rising and setting of Robert Pattinson’s head. It is an amazing head, its pale skin stretched across bone that is as geometrically distinct as a Cubist portrait. Denis, who has a seductive visual style, spends a lot of time focused on Pattinson’s skull in “High Life,” which centers on his desultory character, Monte. He’s one of a small criminal crew of good-looking men and women (Mia Goth, Lars Eidinger and the musician André Benjamin are onboard, too) who years ago agreed to participate in a space mission to avoid the death penalty. Their journey ostensibly has something to do with the earth’s looming environmental catastrophe, but mostly plays out as an excuse for Denis to explore the farther, darker side of her imagination. Denis’s work can be intoxicating, filled with strong, attention-seizing, mind-bending images that resonate powerfully. At times, beauty seems to stand alone, untethered to meaning; at other times, it underlines a tangible idea or generates significance by proxy. Years after seeing her film “Nénette et Boni” (1996), I don’t remember much about the story. But its startling, playfully erotic, intensely palpable reveries remain embedded in my memory: the white bunny nestled between a woman’s feathery high-heel mules, the baker’s wife with a creamy, teasing bosom who leans over a display of luscious pastries. “High Life” has its share of striking images that sometimes fit together like puzzle pieces or just float into nothingness, similarly to that errant wrench. The story starts to take shape shortly after the birth of a girl, whose unexpected arrival disrupts the ship’s already fragile stability. Named Willow (and played in turn by Scarlett Lindsey and Jessie Ross), the baby is the first to survive the experimental interventions of Dibs (Juliette Binoche), the ship’s demented doctor. Wearing a long, heavy rope of braided hair, signaling the crew’s many years in space, Dibs has a criminal past, too, but she also has dominion over the other crew members, whom she medicates to keep docile. Dibs isn’t running things, not at first, but she might as well be. She dresses the crew members’ wounds and tends to the sick, offers unwelcome douching advice to another woman and provides unorthodox if perhaps welcome T.L.C. to a dying man. Her most significant and unusual duty, though, is collecting semen (donors are rewarded with pills) that she uses to impregnate the women. Dibs has her reasons, naturally, though they’re so unpersuasive that you have to wonder why Denis bothered, especially given that narrative logic isn’t much of interest to her. What interests Denis is everything else, including the disembodied exchange of bodily fluids between a man and a woman. A few other things interest her, including desire, sublimated and unleashed. As is often the case in Denis’s movies, “High Life” vibrates with low-key erotic energy that can feel exciting, a little dangerous. (She wrote it with Jean-Pol Fargeau.) One reason is the obvious seductive appeal of performers like Pattinson, Binoche and Benjamin, whose faces and bodies are alternately flooded with flattering light or eye-straining washes of red and blue. But Denis doesn’t just prettify her actors: She lingers on their forms, their skin, stressing texture that becomes tactile. When her camera pans across a downy arm, you see it but also remember — and feel — the downiness and pleasures of other arms, legs, faces. Things happen, some ridiculous and exasperating, others effectively and productively surprising (like Dibs’s desperate, lonely sexual writhing). Pattinson’s vivid presence and intimate voice-over help shape a movie that often feels on the verge of disintegrating. He keeps you watching, as do the images of reverberant, often haunting power and beauty, including a fecund garden in which kale, berries and gourds grow in bleak contrast to the ship’s laboratory fetuses. But too often the ideas here, visual and otherwise, feel haphazard — outer and inner space, Pattinson’s head, sexual taboo, apocalypse now or maybe then — more like material for a vision board than a fully realized vision."
51,The Wind,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/the-wind-review.html,"Two couples, two pregnancies and two dead bodies right up front make “The Wind,” Emma Tammi’s first narrative feature, a frontier ghost story with very human stakes. And maybe a very human explanation: Like Tommy Lee Jones’s marvelous 2014 Western, “The Homesman,” this pioneer chiller shines a gender-specific spotlight on the ways isolation and hardship can ravage a woman’s mind. The first time we see Lizzy (an intense Caitlin Gerard), she’s exiting her log cabin bearing a bloody bundle and wearing a traumatized expression. “How did she get my gun?” she asks her husband, Isaac (Ashley Zukerman), and their new neighbor, Gideon (Dylan McTee), whose erstwhile wife, Emma (Julia Goldani Telles), is about to follow her newborn into the ground. Frequent flashbacks show Emma’s gradual descent from emotional fragility to hallucinatory breakdown as a religious tract about demons becomes an obsession. Soon Lizzy, left alone while Isaac fetches supplies, is also beset by terrifying, shape-shifting apparitions. Their provenance and intentions are unclear, but Lizzy, a staunch German immigrant, isn’t about to give in to her fears. Atmospheric if narratively thin, “The Wind” (similarities to the 1928 silent film of the same name are coincidental) kicks up a competitive dynamic between the two women that further muddies the psychological waters. Teresa Sutherland’s nonlinear screenplay emphasizes the godlessness of the setting, while terse dialogue and a moaning, percussive sound design enhance its oppressive loneliness. The movie’s most striking aspect, though, is Lyn Moncrief’s arresting cinematography, which turns the vast vacancy of the plains into both hostile observer and hellish metaphor. The story might finally slip its leash, but the baleful mood holds firm."
52,The Silence,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/movies/the-silence-of-others-review.html,"After Gen. Francisco Franco’s death in 1975, Spain faced the question of how to address crimes committed during nearly four decades of dictatorship. A 1977 amnesty law offered a solution, absolving Franco’s political opponents while shielding his supporters from prosecution. For the principal subjects of “The Silence of Others” — victims of human rights abuses during Franco’s regime, or in some cases their descendants — that amnesty law has proved a formidable obstacle to justice. Much of this documentary, directed by Almudena Carracedo and Robert Bahar, follows the progress of a lawsuit that a group filed in 2010 in Argentina, whose courts, using a principle called universal jurisdiction, could theoretically step in where Spain’s would not. Among those featured in the film are José María Galante, who explains that he lives “just meters” from the man he says tortured him. (There are shades of “Death and the Maiden” here.) Another plaintiff, Ascensión Mendieta Ibarra, seeks to recover the bones of her father, who died in 1939, from a mass grave. The movie is at its most startling in showing how vestiges of the Franco era have casually persisted in Spain, in the names of streets, for instance. The documentary could be clearer in explaining the intricacies of the international legal wrangling. Extradition proceedings are one thing, but the film is fuzzier on how a judge in Argentina is able to compel an exhumation in Spain. Of course, the mere existence of legal proceedings abroad puts pressure on Spain to attend to its past. That’s certainly the goal of this years-spanning documentary, which is informative, if not always as specific as it might have been."
53,Hellboy,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/movies/hellboy-review.html,"Exuberantly British and quite possibly off its rocker, “Hellboy” is a crack pipe of a movie. Rebooting Guillermo del Toro’s 2004 and 2008 appropriations of Mike Mignola’s comic-book character — a rosacea-hued colossus with filed-down horns and do-gooder goals — the British director Neil Marshall turns all the dials to 11 and keeps them there. This aural and visual assault poses the question: Exactly how much stimulation do studios think audiences need? A great deal, apparently, as this new “Hellboy” (with David Harbour replacing the irreplaceable Ron Perlman as our knobheaded hero) tears through multiple countries, 16 centuries and a bevy of supernatural sources to save mankind from, among other things, a bunch of enraged giants. (The insane script, a bedlam of witches, fairies, Nazis and ectoplasm, is by Andrew Cosby.) In Hellboy’s way stands Milla Jovovich as a reconstituted sorceress (previously sliced-and-diced for our safety) and an array of imaginative weapons including electrified pigstickers, Excalibur and a proper English breakfast. No prizes for guessing which is the most deadly. Arthurian legend isn’t all that’s violated here, even if the closest we get to sex is a disgustingly viscous snog between Hellboy and a randy crone. (The special effects are often more gooey than ghoulish.) Marshall, a world away from the dank dread and crawling terror of his 2006 spelunking stunner, “The Descent,” directs like a dog at a squirrel convention, charging gleefully from one witlessly violent encounter to the next. Ian McShane, as Hellboy’s adoptive father, does what he can to calm the chaos, but the movie left me alternately baffled and battered. “The end is coming,” Hellboy’s dying friend says near the beginning, and I was already thinking, “Oh yes, please.”"
54,Little,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/movies/dolittle-review.html,"At some point during its troubled gestation, the movie once known as “The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle” was renamed “Dolittle.” Was “voyage” too fusty, “doctor” too fancy?  Whatever the case, it’s too bad that the rest of this movie couldn’t have been ditched as well, or at least dramatically shortened. A dreary, overextended yawn, this is the latest movie to feature John Dolittle, the doctor turned horse whisperer that Hugh Lofting, a British-born civil engineer, invented during World War I in letters to his children from the front. (He also drew the illustrations.) Robert Downey Jr., working an indistinct accent (Welsh? Scottish?), stars as Dolittle, now a recluse, who in the wake of a tragedy has retreated to his manor in Victorian England. There, he lives with a computer-generated menagerie voiced by an army of actors who include Tom Holland (as a pacific dog), Octavia Spencer (an excitable duck) and Emma Thompson as Poly, a bright blue parrot with a battered beak. Poly spends a lot of time gently yet firmly bossing Dolittle around like a cliché of a wife, an interspecies dynamic that’s lightly amusing (and weird) to think about when things slow down. Dolittle’s wife died a while ago, as women often do in movies for children. The only living woman around is the young Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley), a Dolittle partisan who’s been stricken by an enigmatic ailment. The dodgy courtier (Jim Broadbent) hovering nearby looks like he knows the answer, but because Dolittle needs something to do, he and his furred and feathered friends set sail for a cure. Cue the flat jokes, deep ocean dive and awfully long haul. Whales swim by, a dragon grouses, Dolittle’s zoo scurries and cracks wise, and so does Downey. No one throws scat or has an accident on the rug, although the live-action Michael Sheen amusingly hogs all his scenes as a Dolittle rival, while Antonio Banderas peacocks through as a pirate king. This is the fourth Dolittle movie and likely won’t be the last. The first, “Doctor Dolittle” (1967), a musical with Rex Harrison, was a box-office disaster; three decades later, Eddie Murphy stepped into the role, starring in back-to-back hits. Downey’s “Iron Man” muscle and the success of the Murphy films probably explains why Universal bid on an untitled “Dolittle” project to be written and directed by Stephen Gaghan, best known for unfunny political films like “Syriana” and “Traffic.” Gaghan apparently ran into issues while making “Dolittle,” leading the studio to bring in other filmmakers. Even so, the story remains thin, the performances wobbly, the laughs infrequent. The C.G. animals are watchable if transparently artificial, a plus. No real giraffe (polar bear, etc.) needs to be abused to create another fantasy in which nonhuman creatures behave like cutesy, cartoonish versions of people. The charm of this fantasy has always been dubious and will presumably fade as the natural world continues to disappear and more and more species become extinct. Increased awareness of our contemporary environmental crisis may explain why, unlike the Murphy movies, this “Dolittle” is set in the past. Because if animals really could talk, they wouldn’t be pleasantly cooing and chatting us up as the world burned. They’d be screaming. Dolittle Rated PG for mild peril and a royal crisis. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes."
55,Missing Link,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/movies/missing-link-review.html,"It’s fitting that “Missing Link,” which concerns a lovable creature a step behind on the evolutionary ladder, has been made with stop-motion animation, the painstaking process by which models and puppets are photographed to create the illusion of movement. In form and content, it’s a movie about fighting obsolescence. The perfection of the computer animation would simply be wrong. All hail Laika, then, for making a movie in which it’s a pleasure to ponder the sharpened contours of a pointy schnoz or the tufts of an animal’s fur, which, in the case of Mr. Link (voiced by Zach Galifianakis), as the gentle simian man comes to be known, resembles hair-colored plumage. The imagery is not nearly as eccentric or demented as that in Laika’s “Coraline,” probably the studio’s high-water mark. But even so, the sculpting gives the characters a tactility that lines of coding have not yet matched, and the jerkiness of the movement — only slight in this case — affords the film a warm, organic feel. The evident care put into the film’s design has not, alas, been matched with similar inventiveness in storytelling. Directed by Chris Butler (“ParaNorman,” with Sam Fell), “Missing Link” is a throwback in more ways than one, with a plot that tips its hat to Victorian literature, frontier town westerns and a 1930s creation, Shangri-La. Sir Lionel Frost (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is a quixotic adventurer who longs for acceptance from a stuffy British geographical society. In the opening sequence, he and a put-upon assistant try to capture evidence of the Loch Ness monster. Frost makes the mistake of relying on one of those newfangled photographic cameras. Never mind, though, for a letter soon summons him on a new expedition to Washington State, where he encounters the talking Mr. Link, who wants to track down his surviving relatives. There are funny running jokes involving the eight-foot Mr. Link’s proportions — a poor fit for a barstool, a train and a plaid suit — and his habit of taking all of Frost’s pronouncements literally. Over the course of their travels they team up with Adelina Fortnight (Zoe Saldana), the brassy widow of one of Frost’s colleagues, and are pursued by an assassin (Timothy Olyphant), hired to kill Frost by his rival (Stephen Fry). The setup is satisfactory. The payoff is somewhat less so, especially once the film begins dealing in platitudes about friendship and the action moves to the Himalayas. The icy land of lost yetis proves, visually, a lot less exciting than the more intricately art-directed details of human civilization. (Emma Thompson, as the queen of that hidden enclave, gets in a few biting lines.) What’s missing from the movie, for all its technical skill, is simply inspiration — that extra touch of wit or imagination that might elevate it from a pleasant diversion to a rare sighting."
56,After,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/movies/afterward-review.html,"“I wonder if any of us have learned from the past,” Ofra Bloch, the director of “Afterward,” says upon hearing the agonizing story of Abir Aramin, a 10-year-old Palestinian girl who was shot and killed by Israeli forces in 2007. Yet when watching Abir’s father speak of forgiveness, and discovering that more than 100 former Israeli soldiers and officers later worked to plant a garden in the child’s name, optimism flickers. Such moments keep this tough documentary from sinking into despair. Bloch was born in Jerusalem, served in the Israeli military and later moved to the United States. To explore her own history, and to better understand rising anti-Semitism around the world, she travels to Germany, where she and other Jews are treated as victims. Elsewhere, she speaks with Palestinians, who curse Israelis as occupiers. The contrasts aren’t lost on the director, who trained as a psychoanalyst and specializes in trauma. She’s an excellent interviewer, asking difficult questions about what her subjects think of Israel, the Holocaust and the Jewish people, then carefully considering the answers. We hear from sympathetic Europeans and a former neo-Nazi; and from Palestinians, some of whom won’t denounce violence, others who promote peace. The resulting emotions are complex, and Bloch, here directing her first feature, can be excused for allowing a few of the scenes to stray. But by the end of the documentary, she and many of her subjects posit that it’s possible to learn from history and to change, and to trust each other a little more. You can’t help but hope they’re right. Afterward Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes."
57,Her Smell,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/movies/her-smell-review.html,"Can you separate the artist from the art? Lately that dusty theoretical question has been revived in reference to certain problematic men. How do we respond when greatness and awfulness coexist, or when talent is used as an alibi for gross misbehavior? Usually by fighting among ourselves. “Her Smell,” Alex Ross Perry’s relentless new film, poses the problem in a different register, and not only because the difficult artist in question is a woman. The lead singer in an all-female trio called Something She, she goes by the name Becky Something. The nom de guerre (Becky is nothing if not combative) suggests both that self-invention is part of her creative program and that it remains incomplete. She used to be Rebecca Adamczyk (she’s played by Elisabeth Moss), and now she’s someone else. The artist, in other words, is the art. That’s just rock ’n’ roll canon, from Elvis (Presley or Costello) to Johnny Rotten and beyond. St. Vincent is a Becky Something, and so is Cardi B. On a more literal level, Becky’s resemblance to Courtney Love is unmistakable, even if it’s also deniable. Some details track very closely; others don’t. But in spite of that warped mirroring, and in spite of its familiar VH1 “Behind the Music” rise-fall-redemption structure, “Her Smell” is no musical biopic. It’s a train wreck in five acts, mostly unfolding offstage. We are behind the scenes in the aftermath of one concert and in the anxious run-up to two others. We are in a recording studio during an especially messy session and in the rambling country house where Becky takes refuge after everything falls apart. I say we are there because Perry’s camera is like a human presence: clammy, curious, caught between the urge to follow Becky everywhere and the impulse to run away from her. That summary isn’t in order, by the way, but disorder is Becky’s method and her muse. Which isn’t quite true of Perry, a highly disciplined filmmaker who has cast Moss in three of his last four features. The more unpleasant people are, the more rigorous his attention to them becomes. His collaborations with Moss (notably here and in “Queen of Earth”) are suites for fingernail and blackboard, unbearable and strangely beautiful. Moss strips away every shred of her charm to reveal her charisma in its rawest state, implicating Perry and the audience in a voyeurism that can feel almost holy. In rock ’n’ roll mythology, the road to transcendence often passes through the gutter, and “Her Smell” sets out a beggar’s banquet of abjection. Shot (by Sean Price Williams) in a blemish-enhancing palette of smudged makeup and unflattering light, the movie barely leaves its title to the imagination. Its images might induce olfactory hallucinations of spilled liquor, cigarettes, nervous sweat and vomit. And genius, too. Moss is deep in Becky’s skin, and Perry is steadfastly on her side. Not that he condones or forgives. She is gleefully cruel and monstrously inconsiderate to everyone around her, daring them to fight back or flee. Her bandmates, Marielle (Agyness Deyn) and Ali (Gayle Rankin), are old hands at sitting out her tantrums and deflecting her taunts. Her ex-husband (Dan Stevens) and her mother (Virginia Madsen) are indulgent and resentful by turns. The head of Something She’s record label (Eric Stoltz) alternates between playing the victim and enabling her forays into self-harm. What does she have to do to drive them away? Who will she hurt the most? Her young daughter? Ali and Marielle? The star-struck punk acolytes who haven’t yet developed antidotes to her toxicity? Herself? These questions are exhausting. But as terrifying and grinding as it can be — long scenes play out in what feels like real time against horror-movie soundscapes, dread dangling from the camera like a lens cap — Becky’s story is also tender and funny. The music and images ache with nostalgia for the ’90s and early 2000s, when the action takes place. The five chapters spread out over six years or so and are punctuated by home-video-style flashbacks to the band’s earlier glory days. Those clips capture them in the full, bratty ebullience of youth, acting out in ways that foreshadow the darker, heavier times to come. Perry is a rock ’n’ roll antiquarian for sure. The make-believe CD cases that pop up alongside the final credits look uncannily like real album covers, and other artifacts of the pre-iPod musical universe are equally right. But he also has a revisionist streak, an interest in reimagining the recent past rather than faithfully reconstructing it. The music scene in “Her Smell” is female-centric in a way that feels both pointed and matter of fact. There are male musicians around, but they are marginal figures, husbands and hangers-on, bystanders at the big show. Which isn’t only about Becky. She has a frenemy named Zelda (Amber Heard), a rival rocker who is Apollo to her Dionysus, or maybe David Bowie to her Iggy Pop. Something She is also entangled with a group called the Akergirls, a younger trio whose sisterly vibe seems like a generational rebuke to the dysfunction that defines Becky’s relationship with Ali and Marielle. (The Akergirls are played by Ashley Benson, Dylan Gelula and Cara Delevingne, who might make you hope for a sequel.) I don’t think Perry is trying to show that women in music can be just as reckless and vain as men, but rather that he’s trying to take such facile gender-based comparisons off the table to home in on Becky’s inner tensions and contradictions. For her part, Moss varies the volume and the tempo of her performance, calling forth cascades of profane invention and rills of whispery poetry, but she always stays in the same key, the key of Becky. Becky is a narcissist, an addict, a liar and an abuser. Still, even at her worst — and the movie is all about her worst — she shows the wit and unpredictability that make it hard for anyone to quit her. Some of that resides in her dazzling verbal dexterity. When she’s ranting, riffing and soliloquizing, a torrent of metaphor, allusion and alliteration spills from her mouth. It’s too much to take in, but it keeps you listening. Her lyrics are more jagged and austere. (The original songs were composed by Alicia Bognanno and Anika Pyle.) “I don’t want to quit/I just want to be in control of it,” Becky sings during the film’s quiet, rural sequence. The line sounds like it’s about substance abuse, and “Her Smell” is unsparing in its attention to the awful thrill of using and the tedium and terror of sobriety. But there is another layer of meaning there, at once plainer and more abstract. The “it” she wants to be in control of, the thing she would rather not quit, is her art. Her life, in other words."
58,Breakthrough,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/movies/jim-allison-breakthrough-review.html,"Documentaries about innovative figures don’t always offer correspondingly innovative filmmaking. But even coloring within the lines of conventional biographical storytelling, “Jim Allison: Breakthrough” provides an accessible introduction to James P. Allison, who, along with Tasuku Honjo of Japan, won a Nobel Prize in 2018 for discoveries in cancer immunotherapy. Allison developed an antibody to keep T-cells, the white blood cells that attack viruses, in attack mode when faced with tumors. The film suggests that the research was personal: Allison’s mother died of lymphoma, and a brother’s experience of prostate cancer, from which he ultimately died, is chronicled throughout. We are told that Allison raised the prospect of the immune system’s cancer-fighting potential at a speech at the Texas Legislature in 1981, when he advocated teaching evolution in the state’s schools. (For Allison, who grew up in Texas, that issue was a long-term fight, too.) The director, Bill Haney, intercuts Allison’s story with that of Sharon Belvin, whom Allison says is the first patient he met from the drug trials. The film does a solid job of explaining the barriers — justified skepticism, professional groupthink, the high cost of long-term research — that Allison faced in proving that a new kind of treatment could work. Cutesier material — a story about how Allison once performed with Willie Nelson at a bar — adds levity to a heavy subject but also plays like pandering, and slow-motion footage of, say, Allison walking the streets of New York just looks like padding. The grind of research isn’t necessarily cinematic, nor need it be. Jim Allison: Breakthrough Rated PG-13 for discussions of cancer. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes."
59,Penguins,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/movies/penguins-review.html,"In “Penguins,” the beautiful but frustratingly shallow Disneynature documentary, Ed Helms provides the internal monologue for a 5-year-old Adélie penguin referred to as Steve, who is about to embark on his first mating season. Helms explains that if Steve hopes to thrive in the Antarctic spring and summer, he must find a mate, procreate and provide food to keep his new family alive. The camera follows Steve as he waddles through extraordinary vistas filled with cliffs backlit by a sun that never sets and ice floes rocked by the tempestuous waves of the Southern Ocean. These are precious glimpses of a vibrant ecosystem, one under severe threat because of ocean warming. But the pressure to build a family-friendly narrative out of these images diminishes the observational accomplishments of the directors, Alastair Fothergill and Jeff Wilson. As a result, nature’s complexities are reduced here to dull clichés. The character invented for Steve is as bumbling and cute as his wobbly walk. But the choice to create an inner monologue for him feels like an infantilizing suggestion that animals must be wholly anthropomorphized to be compelling subjects. And although Helms alternates between perspectives — frequently leaving Steve’s head to offer third-person descriptions of the environment — “Penguins” only grants internal life to one creature out of thousands, concealing the symbiotic relationships that sustain life in such a harsh climate. Even Steve’s mate is silent. As a fairy tale with a penguin for the hero, “Penguins” is proficient. But as a documentary with access to one of the world’s most remote locations, this fantasy feels insufficient and even distorting, particularly when common threats that connect every species — like climate change — are never mentioned."
60,The Curse of La Llorona,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/movies/the-curse-of-la-llorona-review.html,"The scares are plentiful and sometimes ticklishly funny in “The Curse of La Llorona,” an enjoyably old-fashioned ghost story. It’s the latest installment in a rapidly expanding horror series that started with “The Conjuring” (2013) and now includes the “Annabelle” flicks (about a devil doll) and “The Nun” (a demon nun). The connective tissue among these titles can be very thin; here, the most obvious link is Father Perez (Tony Amendola), who’s on hand again to explain that, why, yes, evil exists — boo! Like the others in the series, this one largely takes place in the not-too-distant past, which lends a little atmospheric exoticism to the tale. (Also: no handy smartphones for emergencies.) The main story unfolds in a smog-wreathed Los Angeles in 1973 — cue the flare jeans and Curtis Mayfield. Anna (Linda Cardellini), a widow with two kids, works in social services. She’s still mourning for her husband while trying to keep her family together and do her job. This includes investigating some serious weirdness at the Alvarez home, where the wild-eyed mother (Patricia Velásquez) has locked her sons in a closet decorated with eerie markings. As the title announces, there’s a curse hanging over this story, one that soon bedevils Anna, forcing her to deal with weirdness closer to home. She discovers that whatever haunted the Alvarezes has invaded her life and is threatening her children, Chris (Roman Christou) and Sam (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen). That threat has a name, La Llorona (Marisol Ramirez), a weeping woman in white with an ugly past and insatiable malevolence. Plucked from Mexican folklore (and beyond), this jealous Medea-like figure, whose love turns into consuming hate, has echoed through the ages. She never gets old and she also doesn’t get more interesting, as this movie reminds you. More efficient than ambitious, “La Llorona” is basically a maternal showdown with shock cuts and billowing curtains. The director Michael Chaves, making the most of his silkily mobile, at times predatory camera (he likes to shift the point of view mid-prowl) delivers the horror classics nicely. Every floorboard and door in Anna’s sprawling house seems to get a solo, with squeaks that become shrieks. By the time La Llorona is a regular visitor, Anna’s house has become a haunted world unto itself, each room — bathroom, attic, basement — a stage, complete with a flamboyant entrance and exit. Movies that turn on violence against children can swerve into uncomfortable terrain because kids are such obvious prey but also because the offscreen world is filled with so many real horror stories. There are a few moments, especially in scenes of near-drowning, when Chaves embraces the spectacle of child endangerment a little too lustily. For the most part, though, the movie avoids unmotivated sadism. Like the better titles in this series, it leans on primal fears — the unknown, the certainty of death — and solid actors who can deliver the silliness straight. Even better is how it explores and exploits the divide between comedy and horror. Again and again in “La Llorona,” Chaves creates setups that are so obvious that you giggle, only to turn the dial a bit — and amp the creepiness — so your laughter abruptly cuts out. (The script is by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis.) Much like the prowling camera and the editing that smacks you around, this intentionally unstable tone adds to the spookiness as do the syncopated performances. Anna and her children may spend much of the story in near-hell but when a stern shaman (the excellent Raymond Cruz) delivers the phrase “ta-da,” he and this movie show you a little bit of horror heaven."
61,Under the Silver Lake,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/movies/under-the-silver-lake-review.html,"Sam is 33 years old, unemployed and counting down the days to eviction from his apartment near the Los Angeles reservoir that gives “Under the Silver Lake” its name. He doesn’t seem too upset about his situation, though he is kind of a mopey guy. His malaise looks like more of a temperamental or existential condition than the response to a crisis. And he doesn’t have it all that bad. There are a few guys who are willing to hang out with him, one woman who is willing to have sex with him and a few more who might be, including a neighbor named Sarah with a fluffy little dog. There’s another neighbor who has a lot of birds and walks around topless on her porch, giving Sam an opportunity for a bit of voyeurism and the director, David Robert Mitchell, a chance to nod to “Rear Window.” This is one of a great many nods, winks, rib-pokes, throat-clearings and other gestures in the direction of famous and less-famous movies, comic books, video games and songs. At one point, an issue of Spider-Man attaches itself to Sam’s hand by means of an errant wad of bubble gum, which is a funny coincidence — no coincidence at all, in other words — because Sam is played by Andrew Garfield, who used to be Spidey. Most of the other allusions in this shaggy-dog tale of wild conspiracism and male petulance are not quite so blatantly meta. Sam and the director are both steeped in classic Hollywood, ’90s indie rock, and various kinds of vintage memorabilia. The mood borrows from Hitchcock (whose grave figures in one scene), and also from Nicholas Ray, David Lynch, and the Southern California noir tradition more generally. Also Thomas Pynchon, Robert Altman and Raymond Chandler. These aren’t esoteric references yielding themselves up to a connoisseur’s prying. They are part of the movie’s surface, and part of its point. Sam believes that there are clues everywhere, if only he could figure out what they were clues to. He finds hidden messages in comics, song lyrics and antique cereal boxes, and he connects this information with strange happenings around him. Dogs are being killed in the Silver Lake neighborhood. A billionaire dies in a fiery crash. Sarah (Riley Keough) goes missing. Mix-and-match trios of young women — 21st-century variations on a meme of Betty Grable, Lauren Bacall and Marilyn Monroe in “How to Marry a Millionaire” — float through the city. Our man gives chase, gets sprayed by a skunk, and eventually discovers … Don’t worry. It doesn’t turn out to matter much. The sweet smarts of Mitchell’s first movie, “The Myth of the American Sleepover” (treated to a bit of auto-allusion in “Silver Lake”) aren’t much in evidence here. Nor are the slippery psychosexual scares of “It Follows,” his breakthrough horror movie from 2015. The ambitions this time are grander, but also vaguer and duller. Which isn’t to say that “Under the Silver Lake” is without some diverting qualities. The light, for one thing. Mitchell and his director of photography, Mike Gioulakis, savor the gorgeousness that has seduced so many previous filmmakers. And there are some moments of humor and surprise embedded in the overwrought intricacies and long slack stretches of the plot. But beyond the coy nostalgia and the timid satire is a feeling of bottomless exhaustion. At a crypt party in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, in the company of a balloon girl (identified as Balloon Girl in the credits and played by Grace Van Patten), Sam jumps to his feet to dance to “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?” by R.E.M. It’s a song partly about the latent, mysterious meanings embedded in pop ephemera (“I’d studied your cartoons, radio, music, TV, movies, magazines”), and as such a plausible anthem for Sam’s quest. An equally apt, less pretentious choice might have been ZZ Top’s “Tush,” since that’s mostly what Sam is looking for and the camera is looking at. One of Sam’s prized possessions is an issue of Playboy from 1970 (it belonged to his dad), and “Under the Silver Lake” dwells in a hedged, half-guilty, self-conscious iteration of the magazine’s hedonist philosophy. There’s plenty of titillation and sexual opportunity, but no real lust, passion or liberatory energy. Even Sam’s sense of belatedness feels secondhand. He’s a Gen-X sensibility trapped in a millennial body, with the tastes and obsessions to match. (Mitchell, it’s worth pointing out, is 44 years old). R.E.M. called irony “the shackles of youth,” and he drags it around like a Styrofoam ball and chain. Like other guys his age, Sam feels oppressed by an older generation of guys who lay claim to all the credit, the money, the art and the women, while he is left with a literal and spiritual pile of junk that may not mean what he hoped it would. The movie turns his resentment into a cosmic joke. Look, I’ve been there. But I can’t say I sympathize, because there’s no basis for sympathy. “Under the Silver Lake” is less a cinematic folly than a category mistake, taking the sterility of its own imaginative conceits for a metaphysical condition. It isn’t a critique of aesthetic or romantic ennui, but an example of intellectual timidity. As a Los Angeles movie it lacks the rough, naturalistic edge of “La La Land,” and it thinks it’s so much cooler than “La La Land.”"
62,Family,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/movies/midnight-family-review.html,"Periodically while watching “Midnight Family” you feel as if you can’t look at the screen for another second. But you can’t look away either. That tension encapsulates the push-pull of this documentary, a haunting portrait of a family of emergency medical workers in Mexico City. Because as you tag along on another wild nighttime ride, and yet one more life-or-death race, the family’s careening ambulance seems like an emblem both of their reality and of your own whiplashing position as a viewer. The family at its center, the Ochoas, own and operate one of the many private ambulances that serve Mexico City. The director Luke Lorentzen takes you right inside the ambulance, squeezing you in alongside the Ochoas and several others as they tend to traumatized victims and an occasional member of a patient’s family. It’s no surprise that it can be a deeply distressing fit. Nearly as alarming, though, are those instances when the Ochoas race a rival ambulance to the next accident and the documentary enters that unsettling zone where the pleasures of the chase (and good filmmaking) slam into your ethical sensibility, which is to Lorentzen’s point. Your stomach may start jumping (your thoughts too) even before the movie and ambulance take off. After opening with some sober scene-setting — a man washing blood off a bright yellow stretcher — Lorentzen drops in some of the documentary’s few informational details. “In Mexico City,” reads text on a dark screen, “the government operates fewer than 45 emergency ambulances for a population of nine million.” Much of the city’s emergency health care, the note continues, is handled by “a loose system of private ambulances.” The Ochoas belong to this informal network, tending to hundreds of patients each year from inside their red-and-white ambulance. Serving as his own cinematographer, Lorentzen spends a lot of time in the back of that van, a space that you settle into as workers and patients enter and exit. He regularly points the camera at the windshield, giving you front-row access to the chaos; every so often, he trains it on the rear-door windows, as if looking for an escape. Another camera, mounted on the top of the dashboard, enables you to see inside the van, where Fer, the Ochoa paterfamilias, is generally found riding shotgun beside one son, Juan, a 17-year-old with a meticulous fade haircut and the wheel skills of a NASCAR racer. When the sirens blare and lights flash, Fer and Juan can make a formidable, at times grimly diverting, tag team. “Get out of my way, bicycle!” Fer yells over the ambulance loudspeaker in an early scene, as the intensely focused Juan drives and another of Fer’s sons — the babyish-looking Josué, who’s around 10 — tries to steady himself in the rear. As Lorentzen cuts from the van’s occupants to the darkly jeweled street and back again, everyone and everything passing by is told where to go. “Keep moving, bus!” Fer yells, before slipping into street-philosopher mode. “This is why people die!” he says, over a lingering shot of Josué. “Because people like you don’t move!” The juxtaposition of Josué’s face and Fer’s words are representative of Lorentzen’s method. Embracing a familiar observational approach, he doesn’t talk you through “Midnight Family” but instead lets his filmmaking choices convey his thoughts on the Ochoas and the mercenary world they inhabit. (He edited the documentary and is one of its producers.) Lorentzen never explains how he found the family, who not only granted him seemingly free access to their ambulance, but also brought him into their home. He’s more expansive in the production notes where he says that he introduced himself after he saw Juan cleaning the van while Josué was playing with a soccer ball. “Midnight Family” can be tough to watch, but it never feels unprincipled or indulgently exploitative. Some of the most traumatic incidents have, of course, occurred before the ambulance roars up, but not all. Even when the worst happens, Lorentzen doesn’t turn the gore and tears into a spectacle, and it’s instructive that some of the most dreadful moments take place off-camera or are conveyed through the triage patter or in later conversations. He also tends to obscure the faces of the wounded and whether legally or ethically motivated, this discretion is a relief. It’s humanizing for the victims (be warned that these include children) and for the viewer. One of the enduring hurdles in visual storytelling is how to represent the suffering of others without adding to it, a difficulty that Lorentzen has clearly weighed. That’s evident in his point of view, what he shows you and doesn’t, and obvious in his empathetic portrayal of the Ochoas. They’re an appealing, affecting collection of souls, and you too want the best for them, even when you grasp their role in a system plagued by class inequities and inadequate services, kickbacks and shakedowns. Here, if it bleeds, it leads right into everyone’s pocket — the police, emergency workers, hospitals — a truism that makes this documentary feel finally, appallingly, universal. Midnight Family Not rated. In Spanish, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 21 minutes."
63,Fast Color,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/movies/fast-color-review.html,"“Fast Color” is many things — a dreamlike dystopian drama; a warm celebration of family and female power; a teasing hint of superhero-origin story — none of which fully explains its gentle grip on our attention. What it is not, is speedy, with a narrative that moves carefully, even languidly, and visuals so beautifully patient that we have time to memorize their texture and import. Special effects are all the more so for being used sparingly, and the movie’s few characters feel no need to be constantly explaining themselves. For fairly long stretches, there are no major incidents — which is not the same as saying that nothing happens. Set in a near-future America parched and wilting from eight years of drought, the movie drops us into a car beside an anxiously fleeing Ruth (a perfectly fraught Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a recovering addict whose sudden seizures can ignite earthquakes. The vibrations alert the G-men on her trail, drawing them too late to the dingy motel where she had stopped to rest and dress the mysterious wounds on her wrists. Her destination is a remote farmhouse where her mother, Bo (Lorraine Toussaint, wonderful) is caring for Ruth’s small daughter, Lila (Saniyya Sidney), who barely remembers her. All three can see the colors suggested by the title, though their rainbow-hued significance remains shrouded, and all three can use their minds to disintegrate objects then restore them, good as new. (The utility of this becomes clear later, underscoring the movie’s pacifist message.) These uncanny abilities, which Ruth has struggled to control and Lila is refining at a rapid pace, have been passed down for generations and kept the family in seclusion. Feared and hunted by the authorities, the women are shielded only by a kindly local sheriff (David Strathairn) whose investment in their safety is clearly personal. Moody and strange, “Fast Color” has a solemnity that haunts almost every frame. Shot in New Mexico, Michael Fimognari’s images are wide and graceful, with skies that stretch the edges of the screen and desert landscapes of deep, sweeping barrenness. The movie’s visual boldness is fine compensation for the occasional patches of weak dialogue and rudimentary plotting, the finesse of the camera work a constant pleasure. When Bo pulverizes a lighted cigarette into a smoky swirl of glowing tobacco flakes before delicately reassembling them, the sight is entrancingly magical, its simplicity in keeping with Rob Simonsen’s perfectly calibrated score. A small, intimate story that hints at much bigger things, “Fast Color” sometimes feels like a prologue, an appetizer for a meal that may or may not appear. The screenplay (by the director, Julia Hart, and her husband, Jordan Horowitz) is unfussy and focused, its gentle ecological warnings woven through a modest tale of familial destiny. Rewarding despite its restraint, the movie has an elasticity that pushes the imagination in any number of directions, offering an expressive allegory for a lineage of powerful black women whose strength, unleashed, could literally shake the earth. “This is only the beginning,” Bo promises. I hope so."
64,Someone Great,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/movies/someone-great-review.html,"Hot on the heels of “Girls Trip” and “Rough Night” comes “Someone Great,” Netflix’s contribution to the “girls’ night out” genre. Written and directed by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, the film kicks into action when the college sweethearts Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) and Nate (Lakeith Stanfield) call it quits after nine years. Jenny’s new job requires a move across the country, and Nate decides to break it off rather than deal with dating long distance. As a goodbye and a way of taking her mind off her heartbreak, Jenny’s best friends, Blair (Brittany Snow) and Erin (DeWanda Wise), take her out for one last night on the town. What follows is a story about the lasting bonds of friendship dressed in the clothes of a romantic drama. The dynamic between the three leads is the film’s best quality, but the flashbacks to scenes from Jenny’s relationship with Nate take up more of the film’s attention. The other women are saddled with romance troubles of their own: Blair is in a long-term relationship that has turned lifeless; Erin is afraid of commitment. Both story lines are fun, as each member of the cast is endlessly charming, but they feel like separate movies. There’s a “Blue Valentine”-like drama starring Rodriguez and Stanfield on one side, and a studio comedy on the other. The film succeeds, however, in capturing the way that certain places and songs can take on a life of their own, triggering sense memories of the moments associated with them. The hooks on which “Someone Great” chooses to hang its emotional hats are a little clichéd, but Rodriguez, Snow and Wise have enough chemistry to pull it all off."
66,Avengers: Endgame,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/movies/avengers-endgame-review.html,"“No amount of money ever bought a second of time,” one character says to another — I’m afraid I can’t be any more specific than that — somewhere around the middle of “Avengers: Endgame.” So true, so true, and also in context so completely not true. The intersecting axes of time and money are what this franchise is all about, and while I’m not an expert in studio math, I’d guess that a second of the movie, based on what Disney and Marvel Studios paid to make it, would buy a decent used car. There are roughly 10,860 of those — seconds, not cars — nestled in between the quiet, spooky opening and the last bit of end credits. Which means that whatever a ticket costs in your neighborhood, “Avengers: Endgame” might count as a bargain. At three hours and one minute, it’s shorter than “Titanic,” “The Godfather Part II” or Luchino Visconti’s “The Leopard.” And while the time doesn’t exactly fly, it doesn’t drag either. The two hours and forty minutes of “Infinity War” (also directed by Joe and Anthony Russo) felt infinitely longer. Settling scores, wrapping up loose ends and taking a victory lap — the main objects of the game this ostensibly last time around — generate some comic sparks as well as a few honest tears. And why not? We’ve lived with these characters and the actors playing them for more than a decade, and even when the party got hectic, stupid or crowded, there was no reason to complain about the guests. For the most part, it’s nice to see them again, and a little sad to say goodbye. [Read the screenwriters’ explanations for plot points. | What to read if you want more Avengers. | How the movie did in Week 2 at the box office.] Chris Hemsworth’s Thor, always kind of neurotic for a buff deity with a mighty hammer, has let himself go, turning into a fat Lebowski with mommy issues. War Machine (Don Cheadle), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) have more to do than previously. (I wish that were also true of Tessa Thompson’s Valkyrie.) The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) has made peace with his essential duality. Robert Downey Jr., looking handsomely grizzled, exercises his seniority with a light touch. He’s been around the longest — the first “Iron Man” was in 2008 — and combines the duties of unofficial chief superhero with those of master of ceremonies. It’s not all fun and games. A lot of heroes died at the end of “Infinity War,” and their loss weighs heavily on the survivors, perhaps especially on Nebula (Karen Gillan), whose father was responsible for the slaughter. Thanos’s deployment of the six Infinity Stones to wipe out half the life in the universe was unforgivable, of course — I can’t believe I just typed that — but it proves to have been helpful to the Russos, the screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) and the audience. We and they have a manageable dozen or so major characters to keep track of, which leaves room for some of the alternately lump-in-throat, tongue-in-cheek ensemble work that has always been the series’s most potent weapon. “The Avengers” cycle may require an escalating series of battles to save the universe from ultimate evil — each manifestation more ultimate than the last, with Thanos (Josh Brolin) as the ultimate ultimate of them all — but the engine that keeps it running is friendship. This isn’t the same as harmony. Going back to the earlier movies, Hulk and Thor have had their moments of friction, as have Iron Man and Captain America (Chris Evans). The personal and political bad blood between those two, most acute in “Captain America: Civil War,” continues to simmer, at least at first. But the mood over all is tender and comradely, touched by acute grief and the more subtle melancholy of what everyone seems to understand is the Last Big Adventure. About that adventure, I won’t say much, though it strikes me that the shape of the plot is less vulnerable to spoilage than the little winks and local surprises along the way. [Everything you need to know before “Endgame,” in two minutes] Those are the rewards for sitting through all those movies patiently waiting for the post-credit stingers, collecting Easter eggs while your friends were texting or your dad was napping and generally doing the unpaid labor of fandom for all these years. Was it worth it? In the aggregate, I have my doubts, but the chuckles and awws you’ll hear around you in the theater at certain moments attest to the happy sense of participation that lies at the heart of the modern fan experience. At its best — and “Endgame” is in some ways as good as it gets — the “Avengers” cosmos has been an expansive and inclusive place. That has proved to be good business. Disney and Marvel’s accomplishment will be duly inscribed in the annals of commerce, to be studied for many years to come. There has been variety — silly movies and somber ones; chapters that proclaim their topicality and episodes that embrace pure escapism — as well as consistency. Any single film can serve as a point of entry, and insider status is easy enough to obtain. There has never been anything difficult or challenging, which is a limitation as well as a selling point. None of the 22 films in this cycle are likely to be remembered as great works of cinema, because none have really tried. It’s fun to see the actors in these roles we know are capable of better, and also satisfying to appreciate the efforts of those who might not be. Some first-rate directors have taken up the banner and burnished the brand. Their past and future masterpieces will most likely be found elsewhere. Still, “Endgame” is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it’s really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work. The story, which involves time travel, allows for some greatest-hits nostalgic flourishes, and the denouement is like the encore at the big concert when all the musicians come out and link arms and sing something like “Will the Circle Be Unbroken.” You didn’t think it would get to you, but it does."
67,I Trapped the Devil,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/movies/i-trapped-the-devil-review.html,"A couple find themselves caught in a Christmas nightmare in “I Trapped the Devil,” the promising horror debut by Josh Lobo. When Matt (AJ Bowen) and his wife, Karen (Susan Burke), visit his long-estranged brother Steve (Scott Poythress) for the holidays, they are unnerved by his reclusiveness and boarded-up windows. Their anxiety tips to panic when they hear the voice of a man begging to be released from behind a locked door in the basement. Steve claims the man is the devil himself, leaving his family caught between two possible monsters: either a demon downstairs or a madman upstairs. This is a stylish film, a single-set thriller that uses color, framing and sound to draw out the dread of captivity. The basement glows with diabolical scarlets, and Steve’s hostage speaks with a surprisingly soft voice that reverberates as if his vocal cords were made of metal. These flashes of hyperstylization enthrall, but Lobo does not extend this flair to his characters. They face down the gates of hell in ratty button-downs and jeans, their faces slipping away even when they aren’t shrouded in cellar shadows. Many horror films are built around the conceit of naïve, ordinary people caught in unimaginable circumstances. But great horror movies — including those that Lobo’s film recalls, like Bob Clark’s 1974 classic “Black Christmas” — find ways to make characters a part of the visual experience, using costume design, casting and more to raise simple archetypes to mythic proportions. By seesawing between bland normalcy and hellishness, Lobo denies his audience the immersive horror that his film’s best images promise."
70,Long Shot,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/movies/long-shot-review.html,"“Long Shot” isn’t going to save the romantic comedy, but it’s an adrenaline shot of pure pleasure to the genre’s failing heart. The outline is familiar: Two people meet, retreat and then circle each other, all while talking and talking. The romantic comedy turns on people who fit together — in bed, on the dance floor — but also talk to each other, exchanging words that stop flowing and faltering only with a culminating kiss and teasing fade-out. The difference here is that unlike a lot of romances, the woman retains her power and identity, and that’s how the movie likes it. In “Long Shot,” Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron), the secretary of state of the United States, and Fred Flarsky (Seth Rogen), a struggling journalist, talk a lot. They connect while attending a charity event — Boyz II Men is crooning onstage — spotting each other across a crowded room. It’s a classic meet cute, in the parlance of the romantic comedy, but with a twist. Charlotte used to babysit Fred (she’s a few years older), a fact that still looms large in his memory. They haven’t seen each other since, but when they meet again they quickly spark, lighting a long fuse that winds through the story as nostalgia turns into something sweeter and then heavier. It’s preposterous: She’s a giant, a goddess and he’s … Seth Rogen. It doesn’t bode well that the movie initially seems more interested in Fred than in Charlotte, an apparent imbalance that suggests this will be another weak chuckle-fest in which the female lead is a convenience or decoration, on hand mainly to vouch for her guy’s heterosexuality. The opener, though — with Fred undercover in a roomful of neo-Nazis — proves tactical. It sets a strangely uneasy mood for a comedy, one that’s funny ha-ha but also unsettling. More to the story’s point, it also places Fred in the most toxic of man caves imaginable: a homosocial world of booze-chugging, chest-thumping, sieg-heiling bros. Of course Fred escapes — taunting the enemy, he briefly turns into a self-proclaimed Jewish superhero — and his adventure is folded into a subplot. It’s a shrewd introduction, one that establishes Fred’s ethical principles and willingness to take risks; it also gives him an early, crucial triumph. Just as important, it offers a semi-comic glimpse at a culture that fetishizes manliness and devalues women. When Fred flees, he breaks away from baddies but also from the ultimate in masculinity cults. It’s in keeping with a character who may have a best dude on speed dial (the amusing O’Shea Jackson Jr.) yet doesn’t suffer from the usual movie male maladies, including fear of women. Charlotte soon enters, effortlessly dominating every scene and room while juggling and suffering assorted fools, including the president of the United States (Bob Odenkirk in peerless form). Theron, a natural screen presence who has developed into an undeniable one, is wonderful in “Long Shot.” She’s a fascinating performer with a watchfulness that can make her seem detached. She seems supremely and confidently alone onscreen, which in moments can create an internal tension with her physical superfluidity, her outward, inviting flow. It’s an ideal combination for this character who never breaks stride as she agilely evades obstacles, most of which are men (Andy Serkis, Alexander Skarsgard). “Long Shot” humorously skitters over these and other hurdles, including the imperative that powerful single women must have men by their side, mostly to make everyone feel comfortable with all that female power. That’s a tricky idea for any romantic comedy to take on, one that “Long Shot” doesn’t solve but instead slides over after Charlotte hires Fred as a speechwriter. Much of what happens isn’t surprising, but Dan Sterling and Liz Hannah’s script is consistently, genially funny, filled with patter and nonsense, and spiked with sincerity and a few gross-out flourishes. And while the director, Jonathan Levine, doesn’t do much visually, he pulls off the occasional, well-timed sight gags and often puts Charlotte and Fred in the same shot — they even share the frame — rather than loading up on the usual TV-friendly close-ups of single heads. Movies have long segregated men and women by genre, but at some point we seemed to enter a new age of his-or-her cinema. Straight men and women went their separate, generally unequal ways and stopped talking, really talking, to each other in movies. Men retreated into buddy pictures à la Butch and Sundance or swooned into bromances; for their part, women prepped for weddings that felt like battles or indulged in a hangover-inducing hurrah. The romantic comedies in which men and women hook up have often been excruciating (“The Ugly Truth,” “The Proposal”), fueled by sexist stereotypes and gender policing that suggested women’s lib had given Hollywood a permanent headache. Yet we just can’t quit romantic comedy, even if contemporary American movies as a whole are more comfortable making war than peace, much less love. The reasons are cultural, social and industrial, at once obvious and obscure. One problem is the current business model in which big studios pour tremendous resources into globally salable male-driven blockbusters. The other problem is the industry’s deep-seated, long-maintained fear of female power. In a business long defined by aesthetic and economic conservatism, and that has a bad habit of selling the same stories, women — including those who are sexually desirable, desiring and sovereign — remain a puzzle and a threat. It’s no wonder that after decades of putting women in rigidly circumscribed roles the industry has had a tough time figuring out what to do with them. If things have started to shift it’s partly because heroines like Katniss Everdeen and creators like Amy Schumer are helping redefine the female lead. Like Mindy Kaling and other funny women, Schumer is doing it with laughs and stumbles, but also with an earnestness that affirms something real is at stake: love, hearts and maybe, possibly, a gender-fluid happily ever after. “Long Shot” mostly just toys with some of these ideas; it’s awfully straight, in all senses. But it doesn’t just put a woman on top, it also leaves her there, blissfully."
71,The Intruder,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/movies/the-intruder-review.html,"“The Intruder,” a real-estate-based thriller set in California’s Napa Valley, is more silly than scary. This doesn’t seem to be entirely intentional, and it isn’t altogether unwelcome. The idea of Dennis Quaid popping up in your kitchen in the middle of the night might not exactly be the stuff of nightmares. Quaid, playing a deranged ex-homeowner named Charlie Peck, seems to know this. And the director, Deon Taylor, does too. Still, there are a few jolts and a heavy dose of caveat emptor. The emptors are Scott and Annie Howard, a couple from San Francisco who buy Foxglove, a rambling ivy-covered pile that has been in Charlie’s family for generations. Annie (Meagan Good), a writer for women’s magazines, falls in love with the house. Scott (Michael Ealy), a big-shot marketing strategist, isn’t so sure, but an isolated house at the end of a spooky, tree-lined driveway seems like the perfect place to start a family. Charlie couldn’t be more obliging. He shows up to mow the grass, brings pies for Thanksgiving dinner and helps Annie hang Christmas lights. It takes her a comically long time to detect the creepiness in his attentions, given the twitchy, eyeball-rattling derangement that Quaid brings even to Charlie’s quieter moments. Scott figures out what’s going on a little faster, but behaves like enough of a jerk to make Charlie look sympathetic. Eventually things move from creepy to murdery, as everyone in the audience always knew they would. There isn’t a lot going on here. Annie and Scott have exactly two friends (Joseph Sikora and Alvina August), no family to speak of and not much to talk about. There’s a hint of domestic trouble in their background, and a tragedy in Charlie’s that turns out to be something much worse. But David Loughery’s functional script doesn’t spend much time exploring motives or psychological nuances. Scott needs to defend his wife and his property, both of which Charlie regards as rightfully belonging to him. Charlie is white. Scott and Annie are black. Nobody in the film makes the slightest reference to race, which has the effect of turning it into a subtext — an undropped shoe in a room full of people pretending to walk around barefoot. In much the same way that it’s not about race, “The Intruder” is not about politics, which is to say that there’s a suggestive little allegory tucked into its by-the-numbers plot. Charlie is a guy with a lot of guns who favors red baseball caps. He may have sold his house to the Howards, but he doesn’t quite accept that it’s theirs. When they replace a piece of art on the living room wall with something more to their taste, he’s nearly apoplectic with rage. He wants to take the place back and make it great again, even though it emerges that he messed everything up in the first place, including his marriage and his business. He just can’t accept change, and he’d rather destroy the house than let someone new live in it. Like I said: more silly than scary. Unless it’s the other way around."
72,UglyDolls,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/movies/uglydolls-review.html,"Adults who regularly buy children’s gifts will recognize the denizens of the movie “UglyDolls,” the plush toys of the same name. Milder in design than old-school troll dolls, these figures have a message: Idiosyncrasies of appearance and personality are not “ugly,” but rather emblems of awesome individuality. The relentless positivity of this fable is put across with such bounce-house energy that children in the audience may be bludgeoned into submission instantly. (It made this adult’s teeth hurt.) Here, Moxy, the most cheerful doll in Uglyville, wakes each morning just knowing there’s a child for her in “the big world.” Moxy and some of her misfit pals set out to find said big world, only to be obstructed by the Institute of Perfection, a land of pretty dolls presided over by a pert-nosed, golden-haired paragon, creatively named Lou. He and some mean-girl dolls in his thrall will stop at nothing to thwart Moxy and her dream. These characters are voiced by some of the most prominent names in pop music: Kelly Clarkson, Janelle Monáe, Blake Shelton, Charli XCX, Pitbull and Nick Jonas, to name but a few. Comic talents such as Wanda Sykes and Gabriel Iglesias also feature. Yet every aspect of this computer-animated movie directed by Kelly Asbury seems equally overdetermined and tossed-off, as if it were a caffeinated weekend project for everyone involved. The neon colors bring to mind what a “Candy Crush” movie might look like, while the never-ending songs are cute, flavorless paeans to self-love. Individual scenes evoking “The Lego Movie” and “Toy Story 3” feel like lifts rather than homages, and are blatant to the extent that your older kids might even notice."
73,Extremely Wicked,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/movies/extremely-wicked-shockingly-evil-and-vile-review.html,"Leaning into his hotness with surprising dexterity, Zac Efron plays the notoriously charming serial killer Ted Bundy like someone who has always understood how to weaponize a pretty face. So the problem with the biopic “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” isn’t Efron (or that cumbersome title), but his director, Joe Berlinger. Working ostensibly from the viewpoint of Bundy’s longtime girlfriend, Liz Kendall (an excellent Lily Collins), Berlinger never fully commits. Instead, he appears as seduced by Bundy as virtually everyone else in the movie. Only animals, the film suggests, can resist the killer’s allure, as we watch a whimpering dog back away when Bundy and Liz visit the pound. Even the judge in his televised 1979 murder trial (played, delightfully, by John Malkovich) seems as spellbound as the gallery filled with fluttering young women. “Bless your heart,” he remarks to the showboating defendant, complimenting his legal skills and passively tolerating Bundy’s impromptu marriage proposal to one of the witnesses. Scenes like these strike an unfortunate comedic note that undercuts the seriousness of Berlinger’s point: that devils may come disguised as angels. In documentaries like his stunning “Paradise Lost” trilogy, he has repeatedly interrogated our flawed ability to accurately identify monsters, chipping away at our biases to expose their fragility. Yet while Bundy’s well-documented charisma is on full blast here, we only fleetingly feel its chill. And by leaving most of his heinous acts off screen, Berlinger (who also has a Bundy documentary, “Conversations With a Killer,” on Netflix) is apparently relying on unwitting audiences being as devastated by his guilt as poor Liz. All this makes for a very odd picture, one that purports to care about the women Bundy duped — including Carole Ann Boone (Kaya Scodelario), who married him and had his daughter — while simultaneously marveling at their gullibility. Efron’s smoothly manipulative performance makes a mockery of their devotion, so much so that at times the movie appears less about the psychology of a specific sociopath than a general comment on women who shield such men and even hanker after them. This longing to touch the flame and tame the dragon could have made for a fascinating thread in the familiar serial-killer narrative, but “Extremely Wicked” (the title comes from the judge’s characterization of Bundy’s crimes) is too unfocused and lacking in imagination to pick it up. Early scenes detailing Liz and Bundy’s 1969 meeting and happy homemaking with her small daughter are followed by years of arrests, escapes and multistate charges for his still-unseen crimes. The final third leaves Liz to her drinking and depression as the movie transforms into a courtroom procedural and a showcase for Bundy’s strutting self-confidence. Blurring documentary and drama with the overused tic of playing real-life footage over the end credits, Berlinger still leaves Bundy no more than a slick enigma. It’s the same problem that dogged the director’s excessively flattering 2016 portrait of the motivational speaker Tony Robbins: at a certain point, we realize that Berlinger might simply be unable or unwilling to look beyond the dazzle."
74,Pokémon Detective Pikachu,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/movies/pokemon-detective-pikachu-review.html,"“Pokémon Detective Pikachu” is the first feature to pivot on a pairing of animated characters from the Japanese merchandising juggernaut and real live actors. But why even bother? The human stars barely look like they have pulses. The plotting proceeds with the one-mission-then-the-next logic of a video game, and even the notion of film noir feels bogus. When we see a clip from a gangster picture on screen, it’s the fake movie from “Home Alone.” A video game is, in fact, what “Detective Pikachu,” directed by Rob Letterman, is based on, but its sense of cinematic history extends at least to the long-long-ago of 1988 and “Who Framed Roger Rabbit,” to which it owes what might be called a debt. Tim (Justice Smith) has a deep-seated dislike for Pokémon creatures, just as Bob Hoskins’s private eye did for ’toons in “Roger Rabbit.” That aversion is tested when he teams up with Pikachu (voiced by Ryan Reynolds), his father’s detecting partner, after the father appears to have been killed in an accident. (Pikachu became a gumshoe for Nintendo, but the character, as seen in other Pokémon adventures, is the cute little critter with rosy cheeks who causes storms of electricity.) [When Pokemon go 3-D.] Detective Pikachu has amnesia, though. As if inviting the viewer to pick up a controller, he laments aloud that he can’t solve his own mystery. He can, however, talk to Tim — everyone else simply hears “pika, pika” — in dialogue that sounds like Raymond Chandler filtered through the children’s game of telephone. Their stomping ground, Ryme City, incorporates elements of London, Tokyo and New York but makes them all look like their theme-park equivalents. The town is half paradise and half dystopia: Humans and Pokémon live side by side, even while gamblers egg on vicious Pokémon battles in the city’s underworld and an unpaid journalism intern (Kathryn Newton), sick of listicles, snoops around for a story. (O.K., maybe that last part feels real.) The narrative seems designed to be followed by even those with the shortest attention spans; plot points get repeated in case you’ve decided to look down to send a text message. (“That must have been how Mewtwo escaped,” Tim says of the movie’s menacing catlike villain — right after a hologram has shown us that very escape.) “Pokémon Detective Pikachu” has been shot on film, a nostalgic touch that’s now unusual for a movie that combines live action and cartoons. But the imagery lacks weight and texture. (Anyone who dismissed the technical mastery Steven Spielberg brought to “Ready Player One,” a similar combination of real and virtual worlds, ought to feel pretty sorry now.) This is 1 hour and 44 minutes of Pikachu short-circuiting your brain."
75,The Hustle,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/movies/the-hustle-review.html,"Comedy is in a weird place these days. Stand-up performers and late-night television hosts lean into the politics of the moment, while most movies with an urge to be funny tread cautiously, afraid of giving offense to any segment of the audience. “The Hustle” does some of that — it pushes no buttons and tests no boundaries — but in the service of a higher cause. Or maybe a lower one. Silliness is the watchword. Always silliness. Which is not the same as originality. Directed by Chris Addison (it’s his first feature), “The Hustle” closely replicates a movie from 1988 called “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.” Have you seen it? It’s fun, and it was also a remake, as well as the inspiration for a Broadway show. Like “Scoundrels,” which starred Michael Caine, Steve Martin and Glenne Headly, “The Hustle” tells the tale of two rival con artists matching wits against the picturesque backdrop of the French Riviera. Josephine (Anne Hathaway) lives in ill-gotten luxury in the (fictional) village of Beaumont-sur-Mer, assisted by two loyal, scene-stealing confederates (Ingrid Oliver and Nicholas Woodeson) as she schemes to relieve vain, wealthy men of their money. Penny (Rebel Wilson) pursues a similar racket in less refined circumstances, and with less elegant methods. Her go-to grift is a modified version of catfishing, in which she confabulates a hot sister in desperate need of surgery. Her arrival in Beaumont is an irritant to Josephine, who objects to the competition and also to Penny’s exuberant vulgarity. Their frenemyship evolves through several stages. Josephine offers her services as mentor, hoping to polish Penny’s rough edges. Then they are competing to see who can fleece an American tech billionaire (Alex Sharp) who barely looks old enough to shave but is nonetheless ripe for the plucking. You will probably see the major plot twists coming, but you won’t necessarily enjoy what happens any less. Soignée swindlers in an opulent Mediterranean setting are pretty irresistible, and there’s something reassuring about a story that could have been told, with some variations of tone and topicality, at any point in the last hundred years or so. As with any classic recipe, what matters most is the execution. The financial stakes for Penny and Josephine and their marks may be high, but otherwise “The Hustle” gambles with play money, risking a bit of sentimentality or wounded feelings here, a snarl of meanspiritedness there. Nobody is going to get hurt, but Hathaway and Wilson make decent sport of it. The humor, as you might expect, relies on their physical and temperamental contrasts. Hathaway, affecting an upper-crusty accent as Josephine’s default voice (she has others when she needs them), savors her own chilliness and weaponizes her self-control. Wilson is, well, the opposite — anarchic, profane, warm and obnoxious, using her body like a throw pillow and her voice like a car alarm. Her deployment of the phrase “prima nocta” is a high point. There are others — goofy accents, nicely staged pratfalls, humiliations large and small — though not much that rises to the level of unforgettable, wild-eyed, laugh-out-loud hilarity. But as I said, comedy is in a weird place right now, and “The Hustle” deserves some credit for fulfilling its own modest, escapist ambitions. Unlike a lot of what we see these days, in movies and elsewhere, it doesn’t feel like a rip-off or a scam. It’s downright innocent."
76,Tolkien,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/movies/tolkien-review.html,"“Tolkien” opens in the trenches of the Somme during World War I. The young J.R.R. Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult), a second lieutenant delirious with fever and exhaustion, rushes through bloody, muddy, fetid pathways desperately looking for a friend. Over the tops of the trenches he sees fire that looks like dragon’s breath; eventually he will see, yes, a dragon. Following Tolkien on what seems a fool’s errand is a boyish, worried, unfailingly loyal adjutant named, you guessed it, Sam. The biopic flashes back to Tolkien’s school days; the younger incarnation of the writer, played by Harry Gilby, is placed in foster care after the death of his lively, storytelling mother, and into a prestigious boy’s academy. After some skirmishes with the headmaster’s son, Tolkien eventually makes friends with the young man and his other mates, and they semiformally form a, you guessed it, fellowship. Directed by Dome Karukoski from a script by David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford, this picture about the pre-fame days of the author of “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” teems with many on-the-nose moments. And it does so while hewing so strongly to the Distinguished British Biopic ethos (including the “England: Land of Magnificent Sunsets” trope) that it teeters on the edge of genuine obnoxiousness. Surprisingly, the emphatic score by the customarily more nuanced Thomas Newman is one of the prime offenders. Nevertheless, “Tolkien” manages several scenes of credible emotional delicacy. And it doesn’t shy away from the conspicuously literary, treating the writer’s explorations of Wagner (sparked by his love interest and future wife Edith, played by Lily Collins) and passion for philology (sparked by chats with the intimidating professor Joseph Wright, played by Derek Jacobi) with a commendable amount of detail. But still. Sam?"
77,Poms,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/movies/poms-review.html,"The combined ages of the cheerleaders in “POMS” is well over 500 years, but the movie’s jokes feel even older. An uncomfortable blend of sickness and silliness, this dancing-past-the-graveyard comedy suggests that the many travails of aging can be endured if you only gather enough friends and surrender enough dignity. It might be right; yet there must be better ways to prove it than throwing together some fine actors, then humiliating the heck out of them. By all means, have the terminally ill Martha (Diane Keaton) and her retirement-community pals form an unlikely cheerleading squad. (There’s a real one in Sun City, Ariz., and it’s even called Poms.) But do they have to perform, cringingly under-rehearsed, at a crowing high-school pep rally? And do they need a climactic finale — complete with one member in a bedazzled wheelchair — featuring moves that make the Funky Chicken look refined? Apparently, they do, as “POMS” is uninterested in the credibility or depth that could have made the story worthwhile. Martha has come to Sun Springs to die, yet we learn nothing about her that might contextualize her rejection of medical treatment. Jacki Weaver’s natural earthiness is shallowly repurposed as Sheryl, a randy-oldster cliché (“My only talents are poker and poking”), while veteran performers like Pam Grier and Rhea Perlman gyrate in the background, their characters little more than outlines with creaky joints. Within these lazy sketches, though, genuinely compelling sub-strands — controlling husbands; infantilizing adult children — lie frustratingly fallow. More than anything, this egregiously stale movie needs a talented comedy writer, yet the British documentary filmmaker Zara Hayes directs as if Shane Atkinson’s screenplay cracks her up. Whether it will do the same for audiences remains to be seen."
81,The Sun Is Also a Star,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/movies/the-sun-is-also-a-star-review.html,"A few years ago, I was giving a talk somewhere, and a gentleman in the audience asked, “What is the role of free will in criticism?” I didn’t have a good answer, but the question came back to haunt me during a recent screening of “The Sun Is Also a Star,” a film much concerned with issues of chance, destiny and choice. What, I wondered, had brought me to that dark room where two nice-looking teenagers (Yara Shahidi of “black-ish” and Charles Melton of “Riverdale”) were canoodling in a karaoke booth, and then on an empty Roosevelt Island tram car hovering above the East River? Was it fate? A series of decisions I had made earlier in my life, or that someone else had made for me? Might I find the answers in the writings of Carl Sagan or the poems of Emily Dickinson? If you are fascinated by this line of inquiry, you might enjoy this super-sincere young-adult romance, directed by Ry Russo-Young from Tracy Oliver’s screenplay and based on Nicola Yoon’s best-selling novel. But philosophical interests aren’t a prerequisite and may in fact interfere with the business of watching the two main characters banter, flirt and then, at last, make out. That’s not a spoiler: If you didn’t know that Shahidi and Melton were destined to make out within 10 minutes of seeing them onscreen, you have no hope of passing whatever class this is. Natasha Kingsley (Shahidi) lives in Brooklyn, Daniel Bae (Melton) in Queens. One radiantly sunlit morning, they both have urgent business in Manhattan. Daniel has an alumni interview that he hopes will get him into Dartmouth, a first step in realizing his parents’ dream that he’ll become a doctor. His own ambitions are more literary, but as the dutiful first-generation son of Korean immigrants, he accepts his destiny. Natasha, whose family came to New York from Jamaica when she was in grade school, is on a desperate mission to prevent their deportation. Her parents (Miriam A. Hyman and Gbenga Akinnagbe) are resigned to leaving — they are scheduled to depart the day after most of the movie’s action takes place — but their daughter is determined to find someone to handle the family’s legal appeal so they can stay in the city she loves. (The someone turns out to be a subdued John Leguizamo.) The filmmakers love the city, too. Their ardor is expressed in aerial and street-level shots that highlight the romance of New York without sanding off too much of the grit. (Autumn Durald Arkapaw is the director of photography.) Not that grittiness is the aesthetic here. It’s all warmth and magic and smart, striving kids taking themselves seriously so the audience can have a good time. The story and its trappings feel a little generic, the dialogue studiously bland and the characters and their problems curiously weightless, in spite of gestures in the direction of real-world issues. Natasha and Daniel are sealed in a protective bubble, cushioned in sentimental pop music of various styles and eras — would a Gen Z kid really pick “Crimson and Clover” at karaoke? I don’t know, but it kind of works — and filmed as if they were the most adorable puppies ever to snuggle on Instagram. They are so appealing — I mean, his last name is Bae, and she never makes a joke about it — that you will totally believe that he is a budding poet and that her thing is astronomy. I’m not saying you wouldn’t believe it otherwise, but the passions that these two proclaim for things that aren’t each other seem a bit decorative. They do argue some about fate, love, free will and the nature of the cosmos, but this is mostly so their mouths can get some exercise before they start kissing. There are complications — canceled appointments, Daniel’s racist jerk of an older brother (Jake Choi), a stalled subway train, fate and family — but nothing all that complicated. “The Sun Is Also a Star,” like its title, doesn’t benefit from overthinking. The themes serve the mood, which is charming. You could choose to believe otherwise, of course, but why be that way?"
82,The Professor,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/movies/the-professor-review.html,"At the start of “The Professor,” a glib portrait about a dying academic, the title character, Richard (Johnny Depp), receives a diagnosis of stage-four lung cancer; without treatment, he has probably six months to live. His plan to tell his family is upstaged after, in a single evening at the dinner table, his daughter (Odessa Young) comes out and his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) reveals that she’s having an affair with his university’s chancellor (Ron Livingston). So he keeps the news to himself. And the cancer, far from debilitating him (too much), transforms Richard into a free man. He drives around with shades on and his dog on his lap. He smokes a cigarette — he wasn’t a smoker before — and experiments sexually. To his students, he becomes a mad prophet, dismissing any members of the class who aren’t truly interested in literature and fashioning himself into an unhinged “Dead Poets Society” figure for the rest. (“Do not give into mediocrity like the other 98 percent of the world,” he advises his students, with whom he also smokes pot and drinks.) The writer-director Wayne Roberts complements this tired (at best) depiction of cancer as a liberating force with equally worn-out screenwriting devices, as when Richard lets loose in a mortifying toast at a formal dinner near the end. Depp’s turbocharged archness is basically the whole show. The actor appears as out of whits to give as the man he’s playing, with little interest in enunciating clearly or hiding his self-regard. His mugging can be fun to watch, but he is hardly convincing as a dying man."
83,The Souvenir,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/movies/the-souvenir-review.html,"“The Souvenir” is one of my favorite movies of the year so far, but I almost want to keep it a secret. Partly because it’s the kind of film — we all have a collection of these, and of similar books and records, too — that feels like a private discovery, an experience you want to protect rather than talk about. A direct message like this, beamed from another person’s sensibility into your own sensorium, isn’t meant to be shared. That other person, in this case, is Joanna Hogg, who wrote and directed. (Her previous features are “Exhibition,” “Archipelago” and “Unrelated,” all very much worth seeking out.) But there’s also something specific to the manner, mood and subject of her tale of amour fou and artistic aspiration in early ’80s London that invites discretion. “The Souvenir” feels like a whispered confidence, an intimate disclosure that shouldn’t be betrayed because it isn’t really yours. There’s an interesting paradox here: a movie that feels like it was meant for you alone and also like none of your business. Watching the oblique scenes unfold, at first mysteriously and then with ever greater force and clarity, you might believe yourself more of an eavesdropper than a confidant, as if you were sitting at the next table at the ridiculously fancy tearoom where Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) and Anthony (Tom Burke) have come on a date. Are we sure they’re dating? (Julie’s mother, played by Byrne’s real-life mother, Tilda Swinton, persists in supposing otherwise.) What exactly is their deal? Julie’s is that she’s a film student, trying to put together an ambitious, somewhat vague-sounding thesis set in the northern port city of Sunderland. It’s about a boy named Tony who loses his mother, though the more we hear about the project the less clear it seems. This is partly because the fictional Tony is often competing for Julie’s attention with the actual Anthony. We surmise that Anthony is at least a few years older than Julie and also different from the relaxed, racially and sexually diverse group of friends and schoolmates who gather at her apartment to drink, smoke and listen to records. Anthony seems, at least at first glance, to be from what the British would call a rather posh background. His ironical, world-weary way of talking and his chalk-striped suits and monogrammed slippers suggest a privileged upbringing. Julie, by contrast, puts out a decidedly middle-class vibe, including the way she self-consciously checks her own privilege in conversations with her professors. But these first impressions are soon revealed to be completely backward. Anthony’s father (James Dodds) is a former shipyard worker and an art school graduate who lives with the rest of the family in cozy, rural Bohemian dishevelment. Julie’s parents, meanwhile (the marvelous James Spencer Ashworth plays her father), reek of old, landed money, with aristocratic manners, solidly but not stridently conservative views and enough cash to subsidize their daughter’s student lifestyle in a comfortable Knightsbridge duplex. Anthony claims to work for the Foreign Office. A note of skepticism is in order for the simple reason that, as Julie slowly discovers, he has a habit of lying about nearly everything. It’s not his only habit. I hesitate to mention this — less because of spoiler sensitivity than because of a strange impulse to protect the privacy of fictional beings — but he’s also a heroin addict. And now, like Julie, I’m inclined to make excuses. Not to deny or minimize the increasingly obvious fact of Anthony’s drug use — as Julie does for as long as she can — but to dispel certain false impressions that the mention of it might leave behind. There is a way of describing “The Souvenir” at the level of plot that makes it sound interesting and absorbing but also conventional: another chronicle of addiction and codependency, another cautionary fable of a smart woman making a foolish choice, another period drama celebrating a wilder time. It sort of is all of that, but it is also emphatically not that at all. The title refers to a small, exquisite painting by the 18th-century French artist Jean-Honoré Fragonard that Anthony and Julie behold on one of their maybe-dates. It depicts a young woman, sharply scrutinized by her pet dog, carving letters into the trunk of a tree. “She’s very much in love,” Anthony says with suave certainty, and perhaps he’s right. But there’s a lot more going on in the picture — and in the moving picture that shares its name — than that simple declaration would suggest. The woman is making a mark and putting down a marker, declaring her own presence with a mixture of shame and audacity, impulsiveness and deliberation. Julie isn’t quite so bold, or so embarrassed. She does love Anthony, of course, and she sacrifices a great deal for him without quite realizing what she’s doing. Over the span of the film — it’s hard to know exactly how much time is passing, which is of course exactly how the passage of time can feel — her friends slip away, and the work that had seemed so urgent feels a bit more remote. But the interplay of forces in Julie’s life is subtle, as is the balance, in her own temperament, between decisiveness and passivity. Byrne is a revelation, and Julie is an embodiment of the awkwardness and heedless grace of young adulthood almost without precedent in the movies. Byrne is, of course, the child of one of the greatest actresses alive, but her own talent is of an entirely different order. The point of Julie is that she’s a half-formed creature who we’re watching take shape, partly through the development of her own nature and partly under the influence of external forces. With her soft features and hesitant diction, Byrne gives Julie’s confusion a sensual, almost metaphysical, intensity. For the duration of “The Souvenir,” nothing in the world is more important than what will happen to her. Or, to adjust the grammar a bit, what will turn out to have happened. This movie is a memory piece, after all (with a sequel in the works), set at a time of I.R.A. bombings and ascendant Thatcherism. It’s also a coming-of-age story, implying a backward-looking perspective of maturity. The grain of the film (David Raedeker is the director of photography) shrouds the action in a delicate caul of nostalgia, communicating an ache that Julie can’t yet feel but that we can see forming inside her. This is one of the saddest movies you can imagine, and it’s an absolute joy to watch."
84,The Tomorrow Man,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/movies/the-tomorrow-man-review.html,"Sometimes you’d think there was a conspiracy among movie stylists to turn older female characters into a combination of sister-wife and refugee from a Laura Ashley sample sale. As Ronnie in the late-life romance “The Tomorrow Man,” the lovely Blythe Danner is their latest victim. Swathed in mismatched separates, shapeless woolens and schoolgirl ankle socks, Ronnie is supposed to look quirky; instead, she just looks like she doesn’t own a full-length mirror. Written and directed by Noble Jones, “The Tomorrow Man” is a cloying, at times disturbing tale of two dotty seniors whose eccentricities unexpectedly mesh. Ronnie’s issues, though — she’s a timid hoarder who likes war documentaries — are mild compared to the aggressively paranoid lens through which Ed (John Lithgow) views the world. An apocalypse-obsessed retiree whose time is spent stocking his fallout shelter and communing online with fellow doom-and-gloom survivalists, Ed stalks Ronnie at the supermarket until she agrees to have coffee with him. Ignoring the fact that Ed should scare, rather than charm, most women like Ronnie, “The Tomorrow Man” wends its whimsical way toward love, using physical objects as metaphors for psychological baggage. There is a market for this kind of low-key pablum — especially with such fine leads — where characters are little more than bundles of idiosyncrasies. Yet it’s precisely because Lithgow is so good that Ed’s alarming mental problems resist the movie’s pressure to turn them into comic relief. Had Jones embraced this, a potentially more honest and involving story about dating and mental decline might have resulted, one that didn’t downplay Ed’s hallucinations or his upsetting family dynamics. Or mark key emotional moments with the precious 1970s pop song “Muskrat Love.”"
85,Aladdin,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/movies/aladdin-review.html,"“Aladdin,” the 1992 cartoon feature with Robin Williams as a garrulous blue genie, may not be the best movie from Disney’s second golden age of animation, but like the others it has durable charms and memorable songs. “Aladdin,” the new live-action re-whatever with a blue Will Smith popping out of the lamp, may not be the worst product of the current era of legacy intellectual property exploitation (it’s likely that the worst is yet to come), but like most of the others it invites a simple question: Why?  The answer — spoiler alert: “money” — may not surprise you. I know it’s pointless to complain about Disney’s drive to wring every last dollar from its various brands. You might as well complain about the animal sidekicks (and I will). But the movie itself, while not entirely terrible — a lot of craft has been purchased, and even a little art — is pointless in a particularly aggressive way. [Read an interview with Mena Massoud, who plays Aladdin.] The studio’s earlier cash-grab strategy was to protect the classic status of its “A” material through managed scarcity and lavish reissuing. Each new micro-generation of viewers could be initiated into fandom with a bit of ceremony: Here was an old thing that was being passed on to you in a shiny new package, a polished heirloom in the form of a special VHS or DVD edition or a limited run in theaters. What had belonged to your parents and grandparents could also be yours, whether it was “Snow White” or “The Little Mermaid.” (Not anymore with “Song of the South,” though.) There were problems with this approach, including the preservation of tropes and images that came to seem old-fashioned, and not necessarily in a good way. The patriarchal princess stories. The cultural and racial stereotypes. That kind of thing. But Disney, long committed to doing well by meaning well, has synergized evolving social attitudes with advancing digital technology to concoct a series of updates. None of these have surpassed the original, but that might be too much to ask. I can’t think of one — not “The Jungle Book”; not “Mary Poppins Returns”; not the recent, somber “Dumbo”; certainly not this “Aladdin” — that seems able to stand alone in the popular imagination. They are weird and grotesque hybrids, belonging to no particular era, style or creative sensibility, like dishes at a chain restaurant that fuse disparate food trends to produce flavors alien to every known earthly cuisine. “Aladdin” is not a cartoon, but it takes place in cartoonlike spaces that trade the grace and flow of animation for the cold literalism of computer-generated imagery. The animal sidekicks — a mischievous monkey, a loyal tiger and a malignant parrot — are neither cute nor especially realistic. The human beings occupying the frame alongside them look, with the partial exception of the genie, like people dressed up as Disney characters. They run and jump and dance and sing and wear excruciatingly bright costumes, almost never memorably. Aladdin (Mena Massoud) is a thief plying his trade in the marketplaces of the vaguely, vividly Middle Eastern fantasyland of Agrabah, where he meets and falls for Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott). Her father, the kindly old Sultan (Navid Negahban), is being undermined by his diabolical vizier, Jafar (Marwan Kenzari). Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, are joined by a magic carpet and a blue genie who grants wishes and also develops a crush on Jasmine’s handmaiden, Dalia (Nasim Pedrad). The casting is admirable. There’s a brisk, enjoyable early chase through the casbah — the kind of springy action that the director, Guy Ritchie, does pretty well — and a couple of Bollywood-inflected numbers that remind you, pleasantly enough, of the proud history of the musical as a film genre. Some of the voices may make you regret the reminder. (Scott’s is by far the strongest; Smith is not a great singer). You’ll hear a few favorites from the old “Aladdin,” with new lyrics by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. Alan Menken is still a wonderful composer, by the way. But somehow the most familiar songs, rather than lending luster to this version of the story (written by Ritchie and John August), only highlight its incoherence. “A Whole New World,” sung as Aladdin and Jasmine take a moonlit carpet ride above Agrabah and other picturesque locales, conveys neither the novelty of flight nor the wonder of discovery. The visuals are tired and perfunctory green-screen placeholders. Similarly, the genie’s showstopper, “Friend Like Me” undermines its own premise. We’ve had an awful lot of shape-shifting, motor-mouthed “friends” like this one. One of the new songs, belted out with great conviction by Scott, is called “Speechless,” a ham-fisted attempt to paste some power-princess feminism into the film that feels almost as condescending as the women-in-battle sequence in “Avengers: Endgame.” And as for the film’s supposed lessons — that you should just be yourself and not be seduced by wealth and power — I mean, come on. What makes the Disney classics, old and new, so durable is their ability to fuse commercialism with magic in a way that overwhelms cynicism. When that fails, what we’re left with is thievery. Rated PG. Theft and mayhem. Running time: 2 hours 8 minutes. "
86,Brightburn,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/movies/brightburn-review.html,"A Kansas farm couple is trying to make a baby. The spoons start rattling, the earth moves — but not how you’d think — and the next thing you know they have a son on the brink of adolescence. One night his bed starts shaking — but not how you’d think — and the next thing you know he’s out in the barn scaring the chickens. Also hovering above the ground, speaking in tongues, and throwing vehicles and people through the air. The boy’s name is Brandon Breyer. That’s his earthly name, anyway. On his home planet, they called him something else. Brandon’s resemblance to another young Kansan of extraterrestrial background, with an alliterative moniker and remarkable abilities, is surely no accident. “Brightburn” (the title refers to the Breyers’ hometown), is a superhero origin story reimagined as a horror movie. What if Clark Kent, instead of being grateful to the parents who raised him and a defender of truth, justice and the American way, had been a power-hungry sociopath whose motto was “take the world”? It seems plausible. Skinny, smart and easily picked on at school, Brandon (Jackson A. Dunn) comes to believe that he’s not simply special, but “superior.” Finding less and less reason to play along with the pathetic human creatures who never understood him in the first place, he devises ever more elaborate and bloody ways of messing with them. The soundtrack hums with deep, tooth-rattling vibrations and the prairie sky is full of portents. It’s scary whenever you see the kid on screen, and even scarier when you don’t. The gore and the scares work pretty well. The director, David Yarovesky, and the screenwriters, Mark Gunn and Brian Gunn, hit the genre beats cleanly and efficiently. What makes “Brightburn” a little better than average is the time it spends observing Brandon with Tori and Kyle, his loving, increasingly alarmed mom and dad, who are played with excellent game faces by Elizabeth Banks and David Denman. Before the bodies start piling up, they act as if they’re in a dark, perverse comedy about parenthood. What happens when your sweet little child starts acting weird and doing things you don’t understand, like filling notebooks with creepy drawings and disappearing in the middle of the night? “He’s not our son, he’s some thing we found in the woods,” Kyle shouts at Tori at an especially stressful moment. It feels that way sometimes. You get through it. Or not. I don’t know if “Brightburn” will be the start of a franchise, but I kind of hope so. Not that I’m necessarily rooting for this humorless little dude with a knit mask and a dumb logo to grow big muscles, acquire sidekicks and all the rest. It’s about time that someone understood superheroism as a dangerous pathology. What I mean is: It’s much too late. Rated R. A wave of mutilation. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes."
87,Booksmart,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/movies/booksmart-review.html,"Sometimes your bedrock assumptions about the world and your place in it suddenly collapse, a kind of existential earthquake that makes you rethink everything. For Molly, a Los Angeles teenager, that happens on the last day of senior year, in the school bathroom. It’s no exaggeration — and not really much of a judgment — to say that Molly (Beanie Feldstein) thinks she’s better than everyone else, with the crucial exception of her best friend, Amy (Kaitlyn Dever). Valedictorian and student body president, on her way to Yale and then, she’s certain, to a seat on the Supreme Court, Molly has played the meritocratic game to win. Her morning meditation instructs her to “dominate the day,” and while her peers have been goofing off and hanging out, she and Amy have been hitting the books and building their résumés. It’s thus uniquely humiliating when Molly learns, in the bathroom, that a bunch of kids she’s taken for losers — stoners, skaters, sexpots, slackers — are also going to top schools. If everyone’s a winner, Molly’s whole identity is a sham. This revelation sets off the festival of furious, belated YOLO-ing that drives most of “Booksmart,” a fast, brainy, nasty-but-nice teenage comedy directed by Olivia Wilde. Molly and Amy, who is about to leave for a summer do-gooding program in Botswana before matriculating at Columbia, have one night left to cut loose, and the movie rides in their wake as they bounce through Los Angeles in search of the party that will be wild enough to make up for all the time they’ve wasted playing by the rules. The rules of this particular genre are clear enough. If you’ve seen “Dazed and Confused” or “Superbad” you’ll recognize the mood of aggressive silliness and sincere sentiment that hovers over Molly and Amy’s adventures. Wilde and the screenwriters (Katie Silberman, Emily Halpern, Sarah Haskins and Susanna Fogel) don’t so much reinvent the formula as refresh it, infusing some familiar situations with an exuberant, generous, matter-of-factly feminist sensibility. “Booksmart” is sharp but not mean, warm without feeling too soft or timid. The social stereotypes that have been a staple of the American high school experience as imagined in movies and TV shows going back to John Hughes — or “Happy Days,” or Dobie Gillis — are still intact, but they function as myths to be debunked rather than truths to be upheld. The one dumb thing that Molly ever did was to judge her peers according to categories and appearances, and “Booksmart” gently teaches her a lesson by giving everyone else the same privileges she claims for herself and foists on Amy: to play against type; to be surprising; to change. Feldstein, a wonder in Greta Gerwig’s “Ladybird” as the titular character’s best friend, forges an instantly classic comic bond with the birdlike Dever. Molly and Amy are heirs of Lucy and Ethel, Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton, Abbi and Ilana. Their friendship is the crucial and absolute fact in the movie, though of course it will be tested as the night spins onward. Amy’s well-meaning parents (Lisa Kudrow and Will Forte) have long assumed that Molly is her girlfriend. (Their daughter came out in the 10th grade, and they’re determined to be supportive, even if they’re still a little freaked out.) But the “something special” the two girls share lies “deeper than the deeps of sex,” as D.H. Lawrence said of a different classic friendship. They both have crushes — Victoria Ruesga and Mason Gooding play the objects of their infatuation — but sex and romance are side pursuits, subplots to the main love story. And also, along with drugs and popular music, occasions for Wilde, in her directing debut, to demonstrate a nimble and inventive comic style. The rapid-fire, note-perfect dialogue is punctuated with moments of brilliant conceptual whimsy: animated and underwater sequences; horror-movie jump scares; immersive theater. Though it finds much to mock in the habits and idioms of contemporary youth, “Booksmart” is steadfastly on its characters’ side. It’s not a satire, aiming to puncture the hypocrisies of the feverishly competitive status quo that stretches hard-working children on the rack of parental status anxiety. It’s a comedy, searching out the possibility of happiness within that social order. The movie loves the players enough to tolerate the game. All of the players. The weird rich girl (Billie Lourd). The weird non-rich girl (Diana Silvers). The poor little rich boy (Skyler Gisondo). The theater kids (Austin Crute and Noah Galvin). It’s not quite enough to make you wish you were back in high school, but the affirmative spirit of the movie provides a winning and persuasive counterpoint to the latest dreary flurry of kids-these-days complaints. The older generation, always an easy target, is made fun of in a spirit of pity rather than anger. The few grown-ups who figure in the shenanigans are variously clueless (Amy’s parents), thirsty (the cool teacher played by Jessica Williams) and sad (Jason Sudeikis as the school principal). But they’re all generally benign, and the minimal authority they wield hardly interferes with the anarchic, rebellious — but also, ultimately, responsible — energy of youth. Rated R. Naughty but nice. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes."
88,The Perfection,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/movies/the-perfection-review.html,"Like the classical music its subjects perform so elegantly, Richard Shepard’s “The Perfection,” now on Netflix, plays out as a series of movements, indulging in extreme shifts of key and tempo from one section to the next: For long stretches of time, it seems to be one kind of movie, and then, in a blink, it is something else entirely. The film begins as something like a drama. Charlotte (Allison Williams) is a former cello prodigy who stepped away from her vaunted post at “the premier private music facility for young cellists,” which is run with an iron fist by Anton (Steven Weber) and Paloma (Alaina Huffman), in order to care for her sick mother. In the ensuing decade, Lizzie (Logan Browning) has become the school’s star pupil. Charlotte and Lizzie meet in Shanghai, where they’ve been invited to serve as judges in selecting Anton’s next live-in student. A “Black Swan” dynamic quickly begins to develop between them, in which Charlotte seems threatened but aroused by this younger prodigy. Their chemistry is electric, dramatized by a cello duet sequence that is shot and edited like a sex scene before slowly becoming one. (The editor, David Dean, does some of the best intercutting this side of “Out of Sight.”) [“The Perfection” filmmakers explain their thought process.] Then comes the second movement, and with it, an unexpected, hard-left turn into straight-up body horror. The two young women, still abuzz from their night together, decide to take a day trip on a rickety bus through the Chinese countryside, even though Lizzie is starting to feel a little sick. Just a hangover, right? Yet her illness escalates as they get farther from civilization, and Shepard builds a thick haze of dread around them, waiting out this uncomfortable, escalating situation and the build of her horrifying sickness. If they can’t escape that bus, the logic seems to go, then neither can we. And then … well, that’s when things start to get really interesting. More than that is best left unsaid, as “The Perfection” pulls a daring second-act reframing that amounts to a full-siren announcement that all bets are off. What’s striking is how fluidly Shepard moves from one perspective to the next, swapping heroes and villains, upending assumptions. And the meticulousness of the taut and airtight screenplay, written by Shepard with Eric C. Charmelo and Nicole Snyder, means that what first appear to be loose ends are never left dangling long. Williams is an ideal lead for such narrative sleights of hand. As in “Get Out,” the picture benefits from her particular skill at hiding her secrets, of putting on a brave face or a sincere voice without giving away her real game. Browning (known for taking over the Tessa Thompson role in the Netflix adaptation of “Dear White People”) is a revelation as Lizzie, bringing a scary vulnerability to the role and deftly transforming it into strength. And Weber is a standout in support, his scarf arranged over his tweed jacket just so, a character whose theatricality can clearly swing, on a dime, into madness. Some of the effects are not for wobbly stomachs, including one moment of gore that rivals Netflix’s gold standard, “Gerald’s Game,” and later sections skate into territory that may prove too dark (or perhaps too exploitative) for some audiences. A few moments are rather on the nose (one scene has Weber unnerved when his stereo switches from classical to hip-hop, so uncivilized), and some of the early exposition leans on the kind of clumsy, conveniently overheard conversations that should have been jettisoned in the second draft. The tone also proves difficult to sustain: Material like this walks a tightrope over silliness, and Shepard occasionally loses his balance. But he recovers. Shepard is a peculiar filmmaker, whose jazzy 2005 feature “The Matador” might have been a breakthrough had it found the audience it deserved, and who has mostly floundered in subsequent film efforts. His execution here is often giddily trashy — wild strings and creaky doors on the soundtrack, lingering knife close-ups filling the frame — but it doesn’t feel like slumming. This is a filmmaker aware of the conventions, who wields them with wit and precision and knows his audience is on the gag as well. In many ways, “The Perfection” amounts to little more than a bag of tricks. But no one is pretending otherwise. And they’re good tricks."
89,Always Be My Maybe,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/movies/always-be-my-maybe-review.html,"“Always Be My Maybe” feels a lot like a movie propped up by a stunt, a high-gloss romantic comedy so mired in triteness and unconvincing emotions that its main recommendation is the appealing diversity of its cast. That stunt is a wonderfully self-deprecating appearance by Keanu Reeves, but we’ll get to him in a moment. The early scenes, set in San Francisco in the 1990s, have a charming ease as young Sasha (Miya Cech), a lonely only child, finds solace at the home of her friend and neighbor, Marcus (Emerson Min). The enticing Korean meals cooked by Marcus’s mother (Susan Park) are especially consoling, so it’s no surprise to find the adult Sasha (the dauntingly confident Ali Wong) swanning around Los Angeles as a glitzy celebrity chef. One-pot comfort food, though, has been replaced by elaborate plates of Instagrammable art, which is how we know that Sasha has lost touch with her roots. The movie is rife with this kind of shorthand, sketching characters’ flaws and attributes in broad sitcom strokes: Sasha’s faithless and short-lived fiancé, a restaurateur who practices capoeira, gives Daniel Dae Kim little to play but an empty suit. Even so, he’s a more credible partner for Sasha than Marcus (a bashful Randall Park), who might look like an adult but hasn’t yet figured out how to behave like one. [Ali Wong and Randall Park on why they made the movie.] When they reunite, he’s a grumpy, ambitionless air-conditioning technician and the frontman for an ear-shreddingly awful band, still driving the car he lost his virginity in 15 years earlier. Once again, we have a smart, successful woman hooking up with a weed-smoking low achiever, albeit one who bucks formula somewhat by failing to drag her down to his level. (It’s hard to imagine anyone played by Wong, who first drew attention for her outrageously funny 2016 special “Baby Cobra,” being dragged anywhere she doesn’t want to go.) Small consolation in a movie littered with Spanx jokes, money-focused Asian stereotypes and embarrassingly humorless setups. One particularly wince-worthy scene has Marcus ruin his band’s crucial audition by drunkenly relieving himself on an amplifier. Directed by Nahnatchka Khan, the showrunner of the sharp ABC comedy “Fresh Off the Boat” (which Park stars in and Wong used to write for), “Always Be My Maybe” never shakes off those sitcom shackles. It does, however, gain a lot of mileage by lampooning a familiar kind of culinary ostentatiousness — like Sasha promising that her latest establishment will feature “transdenominational” Vietnamese food — that peaks in a perfectly staged dinner for four in a restaurant whose name, Maximal, says it all. Into this circus of edible absurdity (the meal was scrupulously designed by the kaiseki chef Niki Nakayama) strides Reeves, in windblown slow-motion and accompanied by lustful growls on the soundtrack, as if borne on the back of a horny elephant. Playing Sasha’s celebrity squeeze, Reeves has enormous fun spoofing his action-movie persona and pricking Hollywood pretensions. But he’s a trick, a pointless publicity bomb whose explosion only highlights Marcus and Sasha’s complete lack of sexual chemistry. Their friendship feels real; their romance as unlikely as the food served at Maximal. Always Be My Maybe Rated PG-13 for teens getting deflowered and adults getting aroused. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes."
90,Godzilla: King of the Monsters,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/movies/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-review.html,"The beloved movie monster Godzilla both goes big and goes home in this sequel to the 2014 “Godzilla.” For those of you who haven’t been keeping your scorecards updated, that movie was a reboot of a reboot, the uninspiring “Godzilla” of 1998.  “Godzilla: King of the Monsters” is franchise fodder, however. The series is being steered to encompass a battle between Godzilla and King Kong, like the one the Japanese Big G films from the ’60s once enacted. The sort-of sideways tie-in here is with “Kong: Skull Island” from 2017. While Kong himself appears here in but a glimpse, his home gets a lot of mentions. In this incarnation, a family torn apart by Godzilla takes the foreground. Science people Kyle Chandler and Vera Farmiga use their daughter Millie Bobby Brown as an emotional Ping-Pong ball while government agencies and eco-terrorists contend with the awakening of a fearsome three-headed beast named Monster Zero. It’s rather beside the point to note plot goofiness in a Godzilla picture, but this one does push its luck now and then. At one point it seems the film could go full “Kramer vs. Kramer” with Godzilla and Monster Zero (a.k.a. Ghidorah) as attorneys for the parental plaintiffs. This movie is often pretty slack in matters of story construction and direction. (The responsibility for the latter lies with Michael Dougherty.) Spatial relations are superlax, with characters and heavily armed forces showing up here, there and everywhere from out of nowhere. As in the 2014 film, this Godzilla is a stouter fellow than we have seen in previous incarnations. While underwater, he resembles a giant electric eel with bourbon bloat. But he gets the wreaking-international-havoc job done, as do the many other monsters, including a Mothra almost as delightfully psychedelic as the old Toho version. Godzilla: King of the Monsters Rated PG-13 for fiery monster breath, mass destruction, teen custody battle trauma. Running time: 2 hours 11 minutes."
91,Rocketman,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/movies/rocketman-review.html,"The first album I ever bought with my own allowance was “Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy,” one of two studio LPs Elton John released in 1975. Nestled inside the sleeve was a graphic-novel-style booklet about the singer’s life, a source of great fascination to me at the time. I spent many hours that summer on the beanbag chair in the green-carpeted den, listening to “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” and poring over the tale of how a shy, bespectacled piano prodigy named Reginald Dwight blossomed into the internationally renowned song stylist dominating my turntable and millions of others. “Rocketman,” directed by Dexter Fletcher from a screenplay by Lee Hall, recounts a slightly updated, substantially more candid version of the same story. Back in the ’70s, the fact that John was gay counted as an official secret, as did the extent of his devotion to alcohol, cocaine and other substances. But like that booklet, the movie — a testament to self-realization and a chronicle of recovery — is very much an authorized life. John, now 72, married and many years sober, serves as an executive producer and the author (with his lyricist Bernie Taupin, of course) of most of the soundtrack. (The instrumental score, threaded with echoes and allusions to his hits, with special attention to “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” is by Matthew Margeson.) But the point of “Rocketman” isn’t self-aggrandizement. It’s fan service of an especially and characteristically generous kind. It’s certain that Elton John has nothing left to prove, but it’s also possible that he’s underappreciated. He has been part of the pop-music mainstream for so long — more than 50 years! — that the scope of his genius and the scale of his accomplishments risk being taken for granted. Nearly all the dozen or so songs you hear in this movie were originally recorded within the span of about seven years, and they represent the tip of a musical iceberg with few rivals. Still, I doubt I’m the only listener of my generation who has at times succumbed to the lure of rock-snob dogmatism and worshiped false idols of authenticity, as if Sir Elton’s splendid artifice were something to be outgrown or outsmarted. And I’m sure I’m not the only one who will be grateful to be reminded of how much I loved him, and why. As “Rocketman” tells it, that affection — mine and everyone else’s — stands in painful contrast to the absence of love in Reg Dwight’s childhood. (He’s played as a boy by Matthew Illesley and in adolescence by Kit Connor; the adult Elton is Taron Egerton). Dad (Steven Mackintosh) withholds all affection and approval from his firstborn son, in spite of a shared interest in music. Mum (Bryce Dallas Howard) runs hot and cold, her warmth always contingent on her own needs. After they split up, there’s a harmless, useless stepfather (Tom Bennett). Luckily, there is also a grandmother around — the wonderful Gemma Jones — to notice the lad’s talents and to make sure he cultivates them, with lessons at the Royal Academy of Music. It’s also lucky that Fletcher and Hall, rather than making a standard biopic, infuse this one with anti-literalist elements of jukebox-musical spectacle. Grown-up Elton sings duets with his younger self. Young Reg dances his way to adulthood to the sounds of “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting.” As a result, the chronology is almost as baroque as the melodies. Sometimes the songs are embedded in the plot, as when Elton, early in his partnership with Taupin (Jamie Bell), unfurls “Your Song,” apparently off the top of his head, on the piano in his mother’s parlor. Or, a bit later, when he takes the stage at the Troubadour in Los Angeles and levitates the crowd with “Crocodile Rock.” Other songs — “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” and the title track, among others — function more as musical numbers, giving theatrical vividness and metaphorical voice to Elton’s emotions. Those are heard when they suit the mood, rather than the historical record. The film shrewdly resists the biographical cliché of supposing that the songs originate in or refer to specific moments of feeling. That isn’t really how art works, especially an art as collaborative as Elton and Bernie’s. Their creative alliance is the film’s core, the quiet, non-dysfunctional love story woven through the glitter, excess and heartbreak. “Your Song” becomes the emblem of this relationship. Bernie writes it for Elton, who sings it for Bernie, and thanks to the flexible magic of the second-person pronoun, it becomes a message that each one is sending to the other, and then to everyone else in the world. It’s hard to think of a portrayal of artists at work less invested in the myth of creative struggle. Bernie produces lyrics by the bushel, Elton has tunes by the bucketful, and the resulting hits make both men insanely rich before either turns 30. The trouble, for Elton, is what follows from that success, as his fame exacerbates the unhealed wounds of childhood. The main plot of “Rocketman” follows a familiar therapeutic loop. We start in rehab, where Elton has arrived in full stage regalia, a bright orange jumpsuit adorned with angel wings and devil horns. (Most of the clothes Egerton is shown wearing are replicas of costumes Elton John actually wore, a feat of costume design by Julian Day that is ostentatious and humble at the same time.) We cycle through early striving and midcareer misery. Some of that is brought about by John Reid (Richard Madden), a sharp-dressed music-industry sharpie who notices Elton’s talent, appraises his sexual insecurity and finds a way to take advantage of both. His ruthlessness and Elton’s appetites combine to push the singer to the brink of self-destruction, a precondition for the redemption that follows. Egerton, with what can only be called flamboyant understatement — and also, I suppose, understated flamboyance — in effect plays both the Lady Gaga and the Bradley Cooper parts in a fresh iteration of “A Star Is Born.” His Elton is the hard-living road warrior and the preternaturally gifted ingénue, the sacrificial hero and the plucky survivor, the rock god and the camp icon. The actor delivers a tour de force of self-effacement, a bravura demonstration of borrowed charisma. Fletcher sometimes overreaches, with respect to both spectacle and storytelling — the choreography can be as confusing as the timeline — but when it’s working “Rocketman” has the earnest, extravagant energy of a Baz Luhrmann movie. That description is, in this context, very much a compliment, since Luhrmann-esque showmanship is just what you want in a movie about Elton John. The other thing you want is Elton John’s music, a desire that “Rocketman” by turns satisfies, sharpens and frustrates. The songs aren’t quite the way you remember them, and in most cases the new versions are put to effective dramatic use. But they don’t quite stand alone, and they’re unlikely to displace the originals on anyone’s streaming playlist. That’s just fine of course: The point is to spark renewed fondness for those old records, and for the incandescent meteor of a man who made them. Rocketman Rated R. Sex, drugs, you know the drill. Running time: 2 hours 1 minute."
92,Ma,http://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/movies/weathering-with-you-review.html,"The rain doesn’t simply fall in “Weathering With You,” an anime about love in a time of catastrophe, it gushes. The record torrent that pounds Tokyo throughout is relentless: It floods streets and homes, wrapping the city in a heavy blanket of gray. There’s beauty here, though, in the shocks of color like the red latticework of an Eiffel-like tower and umbrellas that, when seen from above, look like promenading flowers. Every so often, a ray of sunshine pierces the gloom, illuminating a small urban patch. The first time you see the sun streaming, it’s in the company of the teenage Hina (voiced by Nana Mori), who rushes toward the beam as if pulled by a magnet. She finds its terminus on the roof of a derelict building, where the light spreads over bright green, nodding blooms and an incongruously placed red torii gate. A traditional structure found in or at the entrance of Shinto shrines, the gate often serves as an entrance to a sacred space. Putting her hands together as if in prayer, Hina closes her eyes and steps through the gate, changing both herself and the story. She doesn’t travel over the rainbow, not exactly, but slips through a watery portal, landing on a green field atop a mushroom-shaped cloud. The apocalyptic resonance of this image, which invokes the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, hovers like an omen. For now, though, Hina finds peace under a blue sky where fish soar and raindrops fall up, swirling like tadpoles. She’s bathed in light, but then also soon home, waking from a voyage or maybe a dream. The Japanese writer-director Makoto Shinkai has a thing for dualities and a penchant for imaginatively blurring the divide between them. Much like his wistful hit “Your Name,” this movie centers on an adolescent boy and girl whose lives intersect, almost magically, and who mirror each other visually and narratively. In “Weathering,” the boy, Hodaka (Kotaro Daigo), is a teenage runaway who almost drowns soon after the movie opens. Once in Tokyo, he struggles to stay dry, find something to eat, a place to live, a way to live. The story grows more intricate after Hodaka meets Hina, a sweet, friendly smiler with a younger brother and no adult support. The two soon hit on a scheme to sell Hina’s mysterious new gifts as a so-called sunshine girl, a figure who can summon the sun with prayer. In Shinto, the sun goddess Amaterasu is an important deity, but Hina’s realm is far more down to earth. Creating a website, she and Hodaka start selling her rays at a bargain rate, sharing precious light with the city’s grateful, sodden inhabitants. Shinkai fills “Weathering” with bold leaps, narrative complications (the story jumps around in time, not always productively) and softly hued, filigreed backdrops that approach the photorealistic. The character design, by contrast, is more generic, conforming to the familiar stylized anime (and manga) look. Hina and Hodaka have heart-shaped faces with huge gemstone eyes, small noses and tiny, ductile mouths that open wide and comically wider. The characters’ personalities are filled in by the highly modulated vocal performances and by Shinkai’s animation, the discreet and bold choices that make their faces and physicalities pop. The story flows like all the running water, particularly in its fast-moving first hour. As Shinkai briskly cuts from one image to another, introducing characters as he jumps from scene to scene, the story gathers momentum that escalates with a fired gun, a sleazy villain and a rush to safety. The pace is sometimes so rapid that you scarcely have time to look, much less admire the translucent sheen of a plastic garbage bag or the meticulous lettering on a beer can (“Since 1978”). That’s to Shinkai’s purpose. As streets, homes, rooms and faces hurtle by, a textured world emerges detail by detail, one that looks like life yet is also expressionistic. “Weathering With You” loses its way with a diffuse ending that leans heavily on pop songs and includes a fatalistic shrug and a romantic deluge of tears. A late nod at climate change — a close-up reference to the Anthropocene — brings the story briefly into the bleak now. This invocation of environmental catastrophe puts all the rain into new, unmistakable context. It also suggests that a lot of what happened earlier in the story may have been dreamed into existence by two impressionable young souls who, struggling to survive, found refuge in each other and wished the real world away. Whether they did or not, you know how they feel. Weathering With You Rated PG-13 for intimations of doom. In Japanese, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 54 minutes."
93,Dark Phoenix,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/movies/dark-phoneix-review.html,"The spectacle of superhero franchises trying to engage women can be amusing when it’s not insulting, pandering or straight-up weird. “Dark Phoenix,” the 12th installment in the “X-Men” franchise, certainly tries to do right, but the strain shows. It has a female-driven story but odd ideas about empowerment. On the plus side it has Jessica Chastain playing an otherworldly creature who opens a portal to another dimension and a better movie. She keeps you watching even if at times the director, Simon Kinberg, seems more into her risibly high heels. Now almost two decades old, the “X-Men” series kicked off in 2000, making it a few years younger than Sophie Turner, the new movie’s uneasy lead performer. Since then, assorted directors and actors have come and gone amid period shifts, sudsy melodrama, knockdown fights and corporate changeovers. (This is likely to be the last “X-Men” from Fox, which has been absorbed by Disney, Marvel’s owner.) The foundational premise remains intact, though, and involves powerful mutants who struggle with identity and an often skeptical, predictably violent world.  The new movie again features a young, uneven cast that slides off the screen when sharing it with the more seasoned players, most notably Michael Fassbender (as Magneto, a role originated by Ian McKellen) and James McAvoy (as Professor X, formerly played by Patrick Stewart). “Dark Phoenix” narrows in on the young Jean Grey (Turner), a mutant whose mind-and-matter-altering powers get a mysterious boost. Her enhanced wattage disrupts her life at Professor X’s school for mutants, leading to misadventures, tight jaws, unpersuasive angst and a showdown with her past (elevated by the actor Scott Shepherd).  The role is an unfortunately bad fit for Turner, who receives no help from Kinberg. She looks comfy in midair, but can’t fill in the character with the necessary nuances and mood changes. During her long tenure on the HBO show “Game of Thrones,” on which she played Sansa Stark, a royal pain turned leader, Turner learned how to let emotion seep through her mask-like hauteur. She wears a less interesting mask here that, even when damp with tears and fissured by glowing cracks, remains unproductively opaque. (Her indestructible makeup doesn’t help.) Most of the other actors are weak or worse, including Jennifer Lawrence, whose flat line readings (as Raven) suggest she was over the series before this movie began shooting. By contrast — and bless us every one — Fassbender pulls a Hamlet for his thin role. Stalking about in mood-enhancing black, he wraps himself in a brooding heaviness that serves both his character and a series that always insists to thine own self be true. Every time he’s onscreen, you want to keep watching that movie. With charisma, craft and technique — with a flick of the wrist, a turn of the head, a perfectly timed pause, an uncanny gaze — Fassbender builds a dimensional character out of the super-slim pickings. For her part, Chastain has said she drew inspiration from Tilda Swinton to create the character. That’s amusingly obvious from the moment she assumes an eerie Kabuki-like visage, framed by a curtain of white-blond hair and wearing a faraway look that suggests she’s just arrived from a better, more beautiful reality than yours. Like Fassbender, she shows you the movie that should have been. Despite Chastain, the direct appeals to women in “Dark Phoenix” are as embarrassing as they are in the recent “Avengers.” At one point, Raven tells Professor X that he should consider renaming the X-Men the X-Women because “the women are always saving the men around here.” It’s a cringing moment, and not only because Lawrence doesn’t bother to sell the line. She doesn’t sound convinced, so why should you be? And while Kinberg tries to put a feminist spin on Jean’s story, Magneto and Professor X remain the heavyweights, a disparity that’s highlighted by the performances. Kinberg does better when he goes big, which suits this franchise delivery system. For the most part he just moves characters from point A to B, pausing for face-to-face heart to hearts before the next blowout. But the mayhem is generally coherent and executed with clean, crisp special effects, even if Kinberg settles for slo-mo clichés. There’s a nice night scene with a barking dog that he invests with real menace. Better yet is the peek at the sylvan commune where Magneto and his crew have gone off the grid (or something), which after all the generic stress and storm looks mighty inviting. Dark PhoenixRated PG-13 for superhero violence. Running time: 1 hour 53 minutes."
94,The Secret Life of Pets 2,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/movies/the-secret-life-of-pets-2-review.html,"Too scattered narratively to cohere, and yet somehow still funny enough to justify its existence, “The Secret Life of Pets 2” makes for an entertaining trifle. In this sequel to the 2016 animated hit — which followed the misadventures of some Manhattan pets while their owners were at work — our protagonist Max (voiced by Patton Oswalt, taking over from Louis CK, who fell from favor after revelations of sexual misconduct) visits a farm where he has to tap into his more animalistic, confident side under the tutelage of a grizzled sheepdog named Rooster (voiced by a surprisingly engaged-sounding Harrison Ford). Back at home, the brazen bunny Snowball (voiced by Kevin Hart) dons his Captain Snowball superhero outfit after being enlisted by a sassy Shih Tzu (voiced by Tiffany Haddish) to help rescue a baby tiger from a traveling circus run by a creepy, abusive Russian. At the same time, Max’s Pomeranian pal Gidget (voiced by Jenny Slate) has to pretend to be a cat to infiltrate the apartment of an elderly cat lady and her small feline army. These stories, each involving a character adopting a different persona, don’t add up to much, though they do eventually converge in a conventional chase climax. But despite indifferent plotting, “Pets 2” has some winning gags, often cleverly built around these creatures’ all-too-familiar qualities; any cat owner who’s had their pet walk all over their laptop keyboard before knocking over a coffee mug will chuckle in recognition. The movie is a time-waster, but (mostly) in a good way. The Secret Life of Pets 2Rated PG for adorable animals in occasional peril, and a brief gag involving cat litter. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes."
95,Late Night,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/movies/late-night-review.html,"Katherine Newbury, the broadcasting legend played by Emma Thompson in “Late Night,” is the first-ever, longest-running female host of a post-primetime network talk show. A onetime peer and rival of Leno and Letterman, she has outlasted them, surviving into the era of Fallon and Colbert. Some of those names are dropped (and Seth Meyers shows up for a cameo), but Katherine is of course a fictional character. You might even say she’s like a sparkly unicorn or a city-crushing kaiju — a wholly fantastical creature. Not that this smart and breezy film, directed by Nisha Ganatra and written by Mindy Kaling, is especially implausible, other than in the usual charming, comedic ways. Kaling, for example, plays Molly Patel, who joins Katherine’s writing staff after working at a Pennsylvania chemical plant, a career transition explained with a pretty good throwaway joke. The movie’s overall picture of television, though, is drawn from life, and from Kaling’s long experience as a writer, producer and performer. What’s striking is that, in order to satirize the actual sexism of the industry, Kaling and Ganatra have had to imagine the TV world as just slightly less sexist than it may actually be. To put it another way, Katherine’s existence registers as a protest against the narrowness of American show business precisely because she’s such a vivid, complicated, believable person. You can easily fill in the arc of her career — a few fake-vintage video clips are provided to help with the effort — from the early ’90s until now. Thompson invites you to appreciate both Katherine’s seamless professionalism and the effort that goes into sustaining it, much as Garry Shandling did with Larry Sanders back when Katherine would have been in her prime. But now, as the events of “Late Night” unfold, that prime is fading. Honestly, whose isn’t? Nothing is what it used to be. The best lack all conviction, the worst are full of passionate intensity, what rough beast slouches — you know how it goes. (Though the Yeats poem quoted in the movie is a different one.) After nearly 30 years on the air, Katherine’s act has grown a little stale, to her viewers and herself. (Not Thompson’s, though. This is some of her very best work, which is saying a lot.) The network’s new boss (Amy Ryan) is looking for new blood. A youngish white guy (Ike Barinholtz) with an obnoxious anti-P.C. shtick is waiting in the wings to take over when Katherine is eased offstage. She still brings a brainy guest list and a brisk, skeptical British sensibility to her time slot, but whatever edge Katherine might once have possessed has been dulled — by success, by fatigue, by the illness of her husband (John Lithgow), by too long a soak in the lukewarm waters of the mainstream. “Late Night” happily splashes around in those same waters. Rather than scourging the complacency and hypocrisy of television, it subjects the medium to a vigorous exfoliating scrub in the name of feminism and inclusiveness. The humor, though sharp, is cruelty-free. The benefit of the doubt is extended even to the men who have benefited from the old-boy networking that has kept Katherine’s writing staff entirely white and male. They’re not bad guys, just beneficiaries of a rigged system. Kaling’s view of the landscape and its inhabitants — the imperious star, the neurotic writers, the beleaguered producer (Denis O’Hare) — is critical without cynicism or even much anger. The democratic, affirmative nature of television itself is what enables problems of access and representation to be solved. What’s needed, and what Katherine has lost, is faith. “I love television,” says Molly, and Kaling and Ganatra (whose many small-screen directing credits include “Transparent,” “Better Things” and “Brooklyn Nine-Nine”) clearly share that affection. The sincerity is disarming. It makes Katherine uncomfortable. You’d never hear Liz Lemon — or for that matter, Tina Fey — make such a declaration. Since the earliest days, the way to seem smart about television has usually been to act smarter than television, even when you’re on television. Molly, giddily happy about her job and earnestly committed to doing it well, refuses this attitude of superiority, and so does “Late Night.” Katherine, who reads jokes written by guys whose names she hasn’t bothered to learn, is the embodiment of legacy-media arrogance. She’s proudly clueless about the internet, and disdainful of newer forms of entertainment, especially those embraced by women. When she condescends to a young social-media influencer who has been booked on the show, the guest storms off, and the moment goes viral. The Twitter mob is not on Katherine’s side, and neither is the movie, which takes her humiliation as a teachable moment. Her feeling of superiority is a self-undermining defense against her own irrelevance. She has lost touch with the sources of her appeal, and needs to reconnect with the energy and vitality of the present, as well as with her own dormant feminist instincts. There are times when the movie loves TV so much that you get the feeling it would rather just be TV. A whole sitcom-season’s worth of story is shoehorned into less than two hours, as subplots and secondary characters that might have filled up half an episode are confined to a few swift beats. This is as much a compliment as a complaint, or at least a way of acknowledging the strength of the cast and the writing. But there’s a lot to keep track of. Molly’s battle of wills with one co-worker (Reid Scott) and her ill-advised romance with another (Hugh Dancy); Katherine’s marriage, her conflict with the network, her mental-health issues, her sex scandals. It all moves along at a snappy enough pace, but sometimes feels more facile than insightful. The insights are real, though, and the overall resistance to cliché is admirable. Every time you think “Late Night” is settling into familiar tropes — about workplace politics, mean bosses, long marriages, fish out of water, bootstraps and how to pull them — it shifts a few degrees and finds a fresh perspective. It argues that entertainment benefits from the presence of different faces and voices not by preaching but by example. And while you may or may not be persuaded by the thesis that it’s possible to be funny without being mean, in Katherine’s presence that question is moot. She’s something not many movie characters are allowed to be, at least not to this extent. She’s interesting. Late NightRated R. Standards and Practices. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes."
96,The Last Black Man in San Francisco,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/movies/the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-review.html,"The astonishing “Last Black Man in San Francisco” is about having little in a grab-what-you-can world. It’s the haunting, elegiac story of Jimmie Fails — playing a version of himself — a young man trying to hold onto a sense of home in San Francisco. His parents are missing in action and someone else lives in the family’s old house. Given to dreamy, faraway looks, Jimmie seems not quite there, either. But he remains tethered to the city, somehow exalted by it. And when he slaloms down its hills on his skateboard, he doesn’t descend — he soars. The movie was directed by Joe Talbot, a longtime friend of Fails’s, and together they came up with a story grounded in life. Like Jimmie’s family, Fails’s also lost its home, and he and his father — played by Rob Morgan in a brief, piercing turn — bedded down in their car. It’s a plaintive American narrative that here becomes an expressionistic odyssey, both rapturous and melancholic. In moments it feels as if Jimmie and his faithful artistic friend, Montgomery (Jonathan Majors, a mournful heartbreaker), are dreaming the movie into existence, pouring its surrealistic jolts and hallucinatory beauty out of their heads and straight into yours. The story drifts in, as if taking its cue from the fog. Jimmie works at a nursing home, but with no home to call his own, he flops at Mont’s grandfather’s house, a proud and cramped relic facing a polluted bay. There is an ease to the men’s intimacy, a feeling of refuge that wraps around them whether they’re talking or watching old films with Mont’s blind grandfather (Danny Glover, a monumental presence). Early on, the three watch the 1949 noir “D.O.A.,” raptly attentive as Edmond O’Brien reports a murder (his own!) in San Francisco, Mont narrating each beat for his granddad. The tiny audience basking in the flickering light makes for a charmingly eccentric tableau. In another movie, it might read as decorative filler, the kind filmmakers use to mortar together story-advancing scenes. Except that everything counts: the specter of death, Mont’s narration, Jimmie’s perch on the floor. Each detail adds meaning to a story that builds associatively and obliquely, and often through nods rather than shouts. Jimmie is safely huddled in this room, but loss — of his parents, home and city — pervades his life, which means that (just like Edmond O’Brien’s) his future might be lost too. Much of the story and its tension involve Jimmie’s stubborn claim on his family’s former house, a majestic Victorian in the Fillmore district. An older white man and woman live there now, which doesn’t stop Jimmie from rebuking them about the garden or propping up a ladder to paint a windowsill. When they leave for good, Jimmie surreptitiously moves in, filling the wood-paneled rooms with the furnishings that his father didn’t lose during the family’s grimmer times. Mont moves in too and it’s there that he will at last turn his ideas — the scribbles and delicate drawings that fill his red notebook — into a climatic, reflexive theatrical performance. This more or less explains what happens, but it’s the how that matters in “Last Black Man.” This is, remarkably, the first feature directed by Talbot, who shares screenwriting credit with Rob Richert. The story has a clear through line in Jimmie’s odyssey back home and beyond. When he’s not staring into the distance (an untrained performer, Fails has a face for contemplation), Jimmie is on the move, storming San Francisco on his skateboard or rowing off in a fantasy. Mostly, the movie has a cascade of images and ideas, reference points and glimpses of everyday beauty that flow and swirl and, over time, gather tremendous force. The history of black San Francisco is folded in here as well, directly and otherwise. The movie opens opposite the grandfather’s house with a girl looking up at a man in a hazmat suit. She soon skips out of the story, and while there are other references to pollution, you need to dig on your own to know more about the neighborhood, Bayview-Hunters Point, which sits on a peninsula in the San Francisco Bay. For decades, the Navy maintained a shipyard there on which it studied radiation and decontaminated ships exposed to atomic testing. The shipyard employed thousands of African-Americans, and when it closed area unemployment spiked. “Last Black Man” belongs to a handful of recent Bay Area movies about the African-American experience that includes “Blindspotting” and “Sorry to Bother You,” both set in Oakland. In each, black characters confront (among other things) gentrification, a polite word for what, in effect, is a form of white colonization. Taken together, these movies pick up a thread in Barry Jenkins’s wistful 2008 romance “Medicine for Melancholy,” which tracks a young black man and woman through San Francisco. The man hates the city, but also loves it. The hills, the fog — it’s beautiful — and “you shouldn’t have to be upper middle class to be part of that.” In “The Last Black Man in San Francisco,” the desire for home is at once existential and literal, a matter of self and safety, being and belonging. This is of course part of the story of being black in the United States, which perhaps makes the movie sound like a dirge when it’s more of a reverie. Or, rather, it’s both at once and sometimes one and then the other. Much depends on Jimmie, who waxes and wanes, sometimes rises and then falls in a city that — with this ravishing movie — he insistently stakes a claim on, one indelible image at a time. The Last Black Man in San FranciscoRated R. Running time: 2 hours."
98,Men in Black: International,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/movies/men-in-black-international-review.html,"The usual slimy, strange and tentacled creatures slither and galumph through “Men in Black: International.” Some are cute — like the itty-bitty being voiced by Kumail Nanjiani — but some look like leftovers from other fantasy franchises. The critters mingling with humans at Men-in-Black HQ could be on hiatus from the “Star Wars” movies, while a ferocious extraterrestrial suggests a prototype from the “Alien” series. Nearly everything here reminds you of something else, often better, cleverer, funnier. The whole shebang is relatively painless (“Innocuous!” would be my pull quote), a sadly low bar given summer’s already low cinematic expectations. The first “Men in Black” was released in July 1997 and, with Barry Sonnenfeld directing, quickly took off with its bright, fizzy nonsense and its cannily paired leads, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. Two decades is a long time in the movie world, and the original stars, who were joined by Josh Brolin in the 2012 sequel, have been replaced by Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, with Liam Neeson now furrowing brows on backup. All three are nice to spend time with, so that’s something. Disposability has always been a draw of this series, which is high concept enough to support sequels, but generic enough that its parts don’t register individually. A poster for the 1997 film laid out the premise with pictorial obviousness (big guns, a starry sky, sharply dressed men in dark glasses), while the tagline telegraphed the cheeky and breezy violence: “Protecting the earth from the scum of the universe.” The movie was light, silly fun; the stakes were low, the actors charming. By far the most amusing bit was the neuralyzer, the tool the men in black use to erase the memories of witnesses, a service that this franchise has effortlessly managed on its own. The latest edition offers more of the same but with some modifications, none interesting. There are agents, guns, extraterrestrials, special effects, pop-cultural nods and a lot of overt tiptoeing around politics. The most obvious and belabored difference is the presence of women, most notably Thompson, who shares star billing with Hemsworth. It’s easy to be cynical about her casting (trust me), but it is good to see her making bank instead of some Hollywood dude du jour. That said, it’s exasperating (yet predictable) that the movie makes such a great, groaning fuss over the fact that women are onboard, a self-consciousness that reads like self-congratulation. F. Gary Gray can be a fine action director and sometimes better than fine, but the scenes that should pop and pow — given the squealing tires, bared knuckles and laser beams — consistently fall flat. He doesn’t seem engaged in the material, which is understandable, though if you’re not going to take on aliens as metaphor in 2019 it’s hard to know why anyone would bother. Surely there are other studio checks to cash. About the only time Gray perks up are in the scenes with the French performers known as Les Twins, whose beauty and sensuous elasticity prove more eye-opening than any special effect or even Hemsworth’s regularly — and, doubtless, contractually — bared chest. To be fair (really), the script by Art Marcum and Matt Holloway gives Gray and everyone else little to do, even as the story jumps around from New York to London to Marrakesh, racking up clichés with the miles. It says something about the entrenched studio mind-set that despite the bids to bring this series up to representational speed by casting Thompson (Emma Thompson shows up, too), this movie recycles one of the more noxious and durable Hollywood setups: the chase in which fun-loving Westerners race through a putatively exotic site overturning goods and scattering locals who are, of course, the most generic and disposable component of all. Men in Black: International Rated PG-13 for mild violence and many, many guns. Running time: 1 hour 55 minutes. "
99,Shaft,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/movies/shaft-review.html,"There’s a new “Shaft,” and why not? Just to be clear, the latest movie with that title, directed by Tim Story, stars both of the old Shafts: Richard Roundtree, who created the role in the 1971 original and its several sequels, and Samuel L. Jackson, who revived the franchise almost 30 years later. They play father and son, and a third generation is represented by Jessie T. Usher — a dynasty of complicated men. One smooth, one crude, one woke. With plenty of work to do. It isn’t as if the complexities of race, masculinity, violence and capitalism that the first “Shaft” spun into blaxploitation gold have gone away. But this iteration, in spite of a smattering of topical references, is steadfastly not political. Its main comic idea — the sometimes funny script is by Kenya Barris and Alex Barnow — is that Shaft (the one played by Jackson) is not politically correct. He’s another one of those grumpy older guys with lots to complain about, in particular the younger generation. What’s up with those millennials, am I right? Shaft’s son (another John Shaft, usually called JJ) is a member of that generation, about whom Dad and the writers have some unusual ideas. Apparently millennials are people who congregate in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood and also on Facebook, shop at the Gap and can be described as metrosexual. The truth hurts, doesn’t it? Put that in your vape and smoke it, snowflake. JJ does all those things — minus the vaping — and also sends and receives a lot of texts. He also does capoeira and hates guns. Kids these days! Raised by his mother, Maya (Regina Hall), far away from Dad, he has graduated from M.I.T. and taken a job as a data analyst for the F.B.I. He’s secretly in love with his childhood best friend, Sasha (Alexandra Shipp), and turns to Shaft for help when their other childhood best friend, Karim (Avan Jogia), dies of a suspicious drug overdose. Karim, a Muslim military veteran and a recovering addict, is the film’s answer to the question, “Alexa, how can we make this movie seem relevant to contemporary issues?” There’s no point in complaining about the weary mess of the plot. It’s the usual tangle of drug dealing and double-crossing, designed to move us along from one shootout to the next. Story coherence has never been the point with Shaft. He’s all about presence and presentation, and the grace and guile required to deal with the bad guys, the Man and of course all those women. The sexual politics of the moment might be tricky for John Shaft, and Jackson and the filmmakers try to keep him on a tight leash while making it seem as if he’s up to his old tricks. It’s a matter of bark and bite. Shaft says outrageous things, but he’s fundamentally harmless, and also axiomatically irresistible — “a sex machine to all the chicks,” as the ancient version of the title song has it. But whether you take this iteration of the character as an affectionate throwback or a cringe-worthy anachronism, it’s hard to watch “Shaft” without feeling a little wistful. You occasionally sense the presence of an interesting movie struggling to get out of this hyperactive action comedy — or even just a better Tim Story action comedy, something like “Ride Along” or “Ride Along 2.” The generational tensions and the chip-off-the-old-block conceit had some real potential, signaled in the last shot of Jackson, Roundtree and Usher posed as if for the sequel poster. It shouldn’t have been so complicated. Shaft Rated R. I’m talking about Shaft! Running time: 1 hour 51 minutes."
101,Murder Mystery,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/movies/murder-mystery-review-a-whodunit-on-the-high-seas.html,"Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston’s first collaboration, the woeful romantic comedy “Just Go With It,” landed flat in 2011. Now they are back with the sluggish “Murder Mystery,” which does not even clear that low bar. Anybody who has seen “Funny People,” “Punch-Drunk Love” or “The Good Girl” — or early seasons of “Friends,” for that matter — knows that Sandler and Aniston have it in them to be fine performers. Yet for whatever reason, their filmography is overloaded with trifles like this innocuous Netflix caper. The stars play Nick and Audrey Spitz, a New York City couple of big hearts but modest means: He is an underachieving cop, she is a down-to-earth hairdresser. On the flight to their belated European honeymoon, the Spitzes meet the debonair viscount Charles Cavendish (Luke Evans), who, for no good reason, invites them to cruise the Mediterranean on the luxurious yacht of his billionaire uncle. At least Terence Stamp, as said uncle, does not have to endure much of the film because his character almost immediately is murdered. The suspect is among the boat’s guests, a rogue’s gallery that feels like an expansion set of the game “Clue”: a vapid starlet (Gemma Arterton), a funky maharajah (Adeel Akhtar), a hunky Formula 1 champion (Luis Gerardo Mendéz), a one-eyed colonel (John Kani), a hulking bodyguard (Olafur Darri Olafsson) and the dead man’s much younger fiancée (Shioli Kutsuna).  Nick and Audrey must turn sleuths in order to clear themselves from the accusations of a chain-smoking French detective portrayed by the French comedian Dany Boon. (The international cast conveniently represents quite a few of Netflix’s major markets.) Their investigation takes our couple from Monaco to Lake Como, picturesque settings that the director Kyle Newacheck somehow manages to make look like bland Disney World versions of themselves. At its best, which is fleeting, “Murder Mystery” evokes an unholy mix of Agatha Christie and “National Lampoon’s European Vacation,” with an aspirational dash of the 1963 Stanley Donen romantic actioner, “Charade.” Aniston and Sandler have a goofy, relaxed rapport that is often amusing despite the film’s best efforts to smother any sign of verve. One day, perhaps, someone will figure out how to mine the juxtaposition of their differing personas and comic styles. Murder Mystery PG-13 for violence, bloody images, crude sexual content and language. Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes."
102,Plus One,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/movies/plus-one-review.html,"Alice (Maya Erskine) is getting over a breakup. Ben (Jack Quaid) is so busy looking for a perfect partner that he never gives relationships a chance to work. In “Plus One,” these longtime friends from college agree to be each other’s dates to what might otherwise be an unbearable marathon of weddings — weddings whose other attendees immediately recognize that they make a natural couple. (The audience will have figured that out from the premise.) The movie, written and directed by Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer with the crowd-pleasing factor set to max, has a similar marathon quality. Will these two leads be able to outrun so many clichés? Erskine, a comic talent best known as a creator of the Hulu comedy series “Pen15,” suggests that the answer is yes: Her Alice is so effortlessly confident and funny that it’s almost a shame she is destined to end up with a bore of a comedic straight man. (Only Rosalind Chao, as Alice’s mother, comes close to upstaging her.) Quaid, as the stick in the mud whom Alice is always pushing to do things, cleans up well in a suit, having inherited his good looks from his parents, Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan. Unfortunately, his mother’s gift for oddball line readings is in short supply. How many weddings will it take before these ultra-close friends acknowledge their mutual affection? (Even before their arrangement, they feel free enough with each other that Alice is comfortable sneaking into Ben’s hotel room and, at wedding No. 2, they economize by sharing a bed.) The other, more exasperating question hovering over the film is how much back story involving Ben’s twice-divorced father (Ed Begley Jr.) the writer-directors will cram in to explain Ben’s fear of commitment. Only in screenplays and Freud must a character’s psychological profile be simplified so thoroughly. Besides, every minute Erskine isn’t on screen is a minute wasted. Chan and Rhymer execute some showy moves, swanning their camera over dance floors and through hallways with the grace of seasoned waltz partners. The film also locates a bountiful comic subject in the diminishing marginal magic that comes with attending a lot of weddings in a short period of time. (The best-man toasts and scenery vary widely in quality, and Alice almost bails to go to the restroom during one couple’s vows.) Then again, “Plus One” knows from predictability. Plus One Not rated. Run time: 1 hour 39 minutes."
103,Being Frank,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/movies/being-frank-review.html,"In “Being Frank,” an alleged comedy set in 1992, Philip (Logan Miller) is a vaguely grungy rebel who longs to leave his small town to study music at N.Y.U. Philip has flimsy plans to suit his flimsy character — his only meaningful trait is his filial resentment. Directed by Miranda Bailey, the film itself is similarly depleted: It’s a period movie with little style and a family flick wholly lacking in charm or warmth. Philip’s father, Frank (Jim Gaffigan), is a ketchup company executive whose frequent trips to Japan have made him an absentee parent. He compensates for his time away with strictness, insisting Philip stay close to home for college. Philip retaliates by running away for spring break, but a chance sighting of his father leads him to a secret: Frank’s business trips are a sham to hide a second family. Improbably, Philip neither informs the two duped households, nor does he seek revenge. Instead, he tries to blackmail his father for college tuition, and ingratiates himself in Frank’s second home using a fake identity. Philip quickly becomes invested in the charade and begins to help Frank maintain it. At its best, Frank’s shambling deception brings out the anxiety underlying Gaffigan’s lumbering comedic persona, but “Being Frank” is largely an incoherent viewing experience. At its worst, its dynamics are abusive and disturbing. Frank has spent a lifetime lying to Philip, and he robbed two women of their right to make informed choices about pregnancy and marriage. Yet Philip revels in the fraud, enjoying the privilege his newfound knowledge gives him over the two families — a chilling prospect that the movie treats as heartwarming. It signals redemption with halfhearted waves of fatherly affection, ignoring the politics of this family affair. Being Frank Rated R. Language, sexual references and drug use. Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes."
104,Toy Story 4,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/movies/toy-story-4-review.html,"Much of “Toy Story 4” is great-ish. The animation is striking, the jokes amusing and the story sweet, though this being Pixar, the tale is also melancholic enough that the whole thing feels deeper than it is. In other words, the movie is exactly what you expect — not more, not less — from an estimably well-oiled machine like Pixar. It seems almost greedy to want something better, less familiar. The fault lies with the studio, which has trained us to expect greatness, partly by making movies as seemingly inimitable as “Inside Out” and “Wall-E.” Those movies haven’t generated sequels, but serialization in and of itself isn’t the problem with “Toy Story 4.” It’s that this long-running franchise (the first film opened in 1995) already felt over and done by its last installment. In “Toy Story 3” (2010), the boy who owned Woody (gently voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and their colorful playtime cohort, is headed to college and gives his toys to a new child, milestones that seemed to bring the series to a decisive, narratively rounded end. [Read kids’ reviews of “Toy Story 4.”] Never say never in sequel-happy Hollywood; hence this installment, which was directed by Josh Cooley from Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom’s script. Woody, Buzz and the rest now live with Bonnie (Madeleine McGraw), who’s nervous about starting kindergarten. Woody, an old-timey cowboy doll with an avuncular persona, decides to help Bonnie by hitching a ride in her backpack. When she returns home, he’s crammed in next to Forky (Tony Hale from “Veep”), a whatsit she made that day from a plastic spork, a pipe cleaner, lopsided googly eyes and trash-bin bits. The drama first turns on Woody’s crisis of confidence (Bonnie neglects him) and his dealings with Forky, who keeps diving into the nearest wastebasket. (The toys come “alive” only with one another.) Forky in turn opens up a ticklish existential question — is he a toy or trash? — that echoes ideas that reverberate through the series. What is a toy? What is a toy without the love of a child? Forky isn’t a knife, but he minces no words: “Why am I alive?” The same question troubles Woody, who feels at a loss. If Bonnie doesn’t play with him, after all, he isn’t part of her imagination, her being. There’s charm — and a wistful flashback to more ideal times — during this opening stretch, though the story drags as the movie sleepily comes awake. It jolts into full-on perky once Bonnie’s family goes on a road trip, packing a chest’s worth of toys into an RV. Not long after they motor off, Forky hurtles out of the RV one night. This leap into the (relative) void is darkly suggestive of suicide, an idea that is soon swamped by chatter and bustle as Woody heads off to find Forky and bring him back. The runaways soon reunite, ambling down the road in a brief buddy movie. There are further separations and the intro of conjoined plush buddies energetically voiced by Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. There’s also an overdetermined reunion when Woody meets an old friend, Bo Peep (Annie Potts), a porcelain figurine who used to live on a lamp, but has moved on. At last, the story shifts to the antique store that becomes the backdrop for pure dazzle. There, amid shadows and detritus, a handful of delectably creepy collectibles, most notably an old talking doll and her servile ventriloquist dummies, thrust “Toy Story 4” into a visually and tonally richer register. In the almost quarter of a century since this series began, Pixar’s animation has grown more complex and its worlds more lifelike. There’s a real wow factor to the studio’s renderings, to the graphical details and spatial dimensionality that persuasively suggest quotidian existence and our own chairs, floors and trees. This photorealist quality can make you wonder what you’re looking at. (In digital cinema, life and animation blur.) At times, there’s something deeper here, too, as when the visuals suggest textures that you can almost feel in your fingertips, a sense of touch that awakens memories of the smooth plastic and nubby cloth of your own favorite childhood playthings. Pixar figured out long ago that toys can be portals into childhood, assembly-line madeleines. But once you’ve crossed over to that enchanted place where your misty memories mingle with the images flickering onscreen, something needs to keep you tethered. In the first three movies, that hook was the relationships among the toys and their bonds with the child, who grew as the series did. Bonnie and her world — with its sniffles, scrupulous verisimilitude and psychological shallows — are too bland to be interesting. So it’s a relief when Woody and Forky meet Gabby Gabby (dexterously voiced by Christina Hendricks), the antique store’s unloved doll and, briefly, its tiny mistress of terror. Once Bonnie’s world gives way to Gabby’s the movie gets its groove on, turning into a labyrinthine haunted house with ominous corners, scarily frozen smiles, zigzagging Tom-and-Jerry choreography and perilously teetering stuff. Gabby also takes Forky hostage, a turn that creates tension and leads to a rescue mission and a dynamic that evokes Hale’s tenure on “Veep.” It’s almost over before it starts. Yet even after the sun and narrative order re-emerge it’s hard to really shake Gabby Gabby. With her otherworldly eyes and volatility, she is at once a scary doppelgänger for Bonnie and a startlingly honest comment on childhood as a dark well of impossible need. Toy Story 4 Rated G. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes."
106,Annabelle Comes Home,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/movies/annabelle-comes-home-review.html,"Despite remaining laudably committed to its namesake’s hobby of terrorizing little girls, “Annabelle Comes Home,” the latest in the demon-doll saga that began in 2013, is no more than a shameless franchise-stuffer. Burdened neither by fresh ideas nor common sense, Gary Dauberman’s lethargic screenplay (he also directed, an inauspicious debut) takes so long to get moving that Annabelle herself should demand a do-over. After warning us that the possessed doll is “a beacon for other spirits,” the demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) lock her in a special artifacts room in their home alongside other malevolent bits and bobs. A priest’s blessing and signage along the lines of “Super-duper evil — keep out!” complete the security arrangements as the Warrens promptly clear off, leaving their young daughter, her babysitter and a bereaved friend to their own devices. Anyone in any doubt as to what happens next clearly needs to get out more. Groaning predictability, though, is only one problem in a movie choking on haunted-house clichés and so short of genuine scares that its most traumatizing sight might be the Warrens’ hideous wallpaper. Shadows flit past mirrors and doors vibrate to the battering of invisible fists, weak teasers with disappointing payoffs. Excepting Katie Sarife, whose subtly shaded performance as the wildly incautious friend augurs a fine career in tough-yet-tender roles, “Annabelle Comes Home” feels stretched and tired. Worst of all, the film’s early-1970s setting allows it to ruin my once-fond memories of Badfinger’s 1971 hit, “Day After Day.” Annabelle Comes Home Rated R for demonic high jinks and hellish home décor. Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes."
107,Yesterday,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/movies/yesterday-review.html,"While it would be too harsh to call Jack Malik a real nowhere man, that’s where his musical career seems to be going. A modestly talented songwriter with a decent voice and busker-grade guitar skills, Jack — played with a winning mixture of moodiness and wit by Himesh Patel — decides to give up on his rock ’n’ roll dreams and go back to teaching school. This is devastating news to his biggest and quite possibly only fan, Ellie (Lily James), who is also his road manager, chauffeur and best friend. She’s carrying a torch for him visible from across the universe, which Jack is too confused or self-absorbed to notice. With a love like that, you’d think he would be glad. Of course, since “Yesterday” is a romantic comedy of sorts with a script by Richard Curtis (“Notting Hill,” “Love Actually,” etc.), it seems likely that Jack will find his way to Ellie sooner or later. We’ve seen that road before. This time, his awakening will require a bump on the head and a small but significant tear in the fabric of reality as Jack and the rest of us know it. “I don’t believe in Beatles,” John Lennon once sang. This silly and sincere pop confection, energetically directed by Danny Boyle (“28 Days Later,” “Slumdog Millionaire,” etc.), wonders what might happen if nobody else did, either. After a traffic accident mysteriously connected to a global power outage, Jack wakes up to discover that the Fab Four have been erased from the collective cultural memory. A Google search turns up pictures of insects. There’s a gap in the B section of Jack’s record collection. When he sings “Yesterday” for Ellie and some other friends, they’re blown away. They want to know when — how, for whom — he came to write such an amazing song. Suddenly, Jack is 10 times the man he used to be. “Yesterday,” meanwhile, scrambles to figure out what to do with its daft, ingenious premise. One thing it doesn’t do — thank goodness — is explain why the Beatles vanished, and why Jack is apparently the only person on the planet who remembers their music. (A few other familiar items have been similarly deleted, but to name them here would steal some of the movie’s hard-won chuckles.) The absence of pseudoscientific or supernatural reasons is crucial to sustaining the mood of breezy romantic wonder and soft, cheeky comedy. The best response to “Yesterday” is to stifle the pedantic voice in your head, the one that wants to know what would happen if Jack searched online for Wings, the Plastic Ono Band or the Concert for Bangladesh. Let it be. But what is it, exactly? For a while, “Yesterday” feels like a familiarly Richard Curtis-y type of winsome, self-deprecating Brit-com. People say clever things that might sound cruel in a different accent, while looking at the tops of their shoes or diffidently tossing their heads. At moments of strong feeling, they laugh-cry or hold back tears until the theater fills with audible sighs and sniffles. Patel is charming. James is charm itself. Joel Fry plays the kind of goofy friend who used to be played by Rhys Ifans.  Jack tries to get his parents (Sanjeev Bhaskar and Meera Syal) interested in “his” music, but they prove to be the only people on earth impervious to the appeal of the Lennon-McCartney-Harrison songbook. Everybody else is just as hungry for those hits as everybody really was 50 years ago. They’re guaranteed to raise a smile, and to make a lot of money. Once Jack and Ellie cut a demo (with an affable engineer played by Alexander Arnold), “Yesterday” expands into a gentle satire of the music industry wrapped in a mellow retelling of the Faust legend. Kate McKinnon takes Mephistopheles duty as a music industry shark who tempts Jack with wealth and fame beyond all imagining. In exchange for what, though? Eventually, the plot narrows to a choice between love and success, but since the success doesn’t really belong to Jack the stakes are a bit muddled. The ease with which the world (except for Jack’s mom and dad) embraces the self-evident greatness of the music put out under his name irons out some potentially interesting wrinkles. Here my inner pedant will not shut up: What if the popularity of the Beatles’ music was as much a product of a specific time and set of circumstances as the music itself? What if, on first hearing “Yesterday,” Jack’s friends took it for an obscure Mumford & Sons B-side? A bit later, Jack meets Ed Sheeran, who is gamely played by Ed Sheeran. Sheeran proposes a songwriting contest, with the winner to be decided by polling assembled backstage hangers-on. In 10 minutes, he comes up with something about a penguin, which Jack answers with “The Long and Winding Road.” Game over. Vote canceled. Sheeran manfully accepts his humiliation and bows to the greater talent. “I’m Salieri,” he gallantly admits. A more interesting — and I would argue more likely — outcome would be for Jack to come in second, accepting the condescending approval of his listeners. Nice try, mate, but come on. He’s Ed bloody Sheeran! Aesthetic quality may be absolute (or not!), but popular taste, especially when it comes to new things, is notoriously fickle and contingent. I’m sure the filmmakers have a good reason for taking the easy way out, but “Yesterday” is more of a novelty earworm than a classic. It’s appealing and accessible in a way that the Beatles never really were. If it took itself — and them — a bit more seriously, it would be a lot more fun. But it wasn’t made to last.  Yesterday Rated PG-13. Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall. Running time: 1 hour 56 minutes."
108,Ophelia,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/movies/ophelia-review.html,"Soon after “Ophelia” opens, the title character is floating face up in a river. The image evokes John Everett Millais’s 1850s painting that shows a supine Ophelia soon after she has drowned. Her pale palms are turned up, flowers spilling out of one hand. Her eyes are open, her lips prettily parted, as if she had received the gentlest of surprises. It’s quite a vision of Eros and Thanatos in one beautiful necrophiliac package. “Ophelia” seeks to revamp the image of its title heroine (Daisy Ridley) as a tragic, largely passive casualty, one who is as much a victim of Shakespeare’s era as of his peerless imagination. It’s an interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one. The movie sounds and looks good (despite the suboptimal digital resolution), though it is also too pretty, with lush woods, attractive gowns, a stately castle and misty lakes. It also isn’t remotely Shakespeare’s “Hamlet,” despite the characters, the Danish setting and the self-conscious attempt to suggest his language. This is instead Ophelia as a 21st-century heroine, who after a smudge-faced childhood running wild in her king’s castle — and being excluded from studying with the boys — grows into a woman with desires, ambitions and a pronounced rebellious streak. Yet like Shakespeare’s version, this Ophelia has serious issues, including love trouble with the still-brooding Hamlet (a good, underused George MacKay). Now, though, she has richer, more familial ties to Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts) and an uneasy relationship with Gertrude’s look-alike (Watts), a witchy forest dweller who seems to have wandered in from “Macbeth.” (The script by Semi Chellas is based on Lisa Klein’s Y.A. novel.) The director Claire McCarthy sets an energetic pace that rarely eases, as if taking her cue from the introduction of Ophelia (Mia Quiney) when she was one of the castle’s child ruffians. Once Gertrude takes Ophelia under her wing, making the motherless girl her charge, the movie retains a clip that could use some slowing. A great deal happens in “Hamlet” (“carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,” as Horatio says); just as much in “Ophelia” but not always gracefully. “You may think you know my story,” she says in the movie, which is an agreeably optimistic claim about contemporary readership. At times, though, all the bustling to and fro feels strained, superfluous. Best known for playing a warrior in the most recent cycle of “Star Wars” movies, Ridley is an attractive, physically confident performer who has enough of that certain alchemical something — a persona that lights up the frame, an auric presence — that she can both hold the screen and your attention. Her resemblance to Keira Knightley, particularly around the jawline, has always been uncanny. In “Ophelia,” though, with its flowing hair and gowns, the resemblance is at times also awkwardly distracting because it reminds you how smoothly Knightley can slip into a period role. Ridley by contrast often seems ill at ease, particularly when called on to express interiority. This scarcely seems Ridley’s fault and presumably neither is Ophelia’s habit of speaking in hushed Malickian tones. Even Clive Owen has a rough time delivering the persuasive goods, and the most notable aspect of his performance as Claudius, alas, is the character’s tragic hair. Other familiar critical characters scarcely register, including the king (Nathaniel Parker), who barely speaks (alive or otherwise) and whose murder of course helps instigate the play’s “accidental judgments, casual slaughters.” His diminished presence creates a dramatic problem that this movie never manages to solve, even despite Watts’s predictably lively, doubly troubled turn. Ophelia Rated PG-13 for something rotten. Running time: 1 hour 54 minutes."
109,Killers Anonymous,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/movies/killers-anonymous-review.html,"“Killers Anonymous” is the kind of movie that makes critics despair and otherwise decent actors rue their involvement. Those with the highest name recognition, however (Gary Oldman, Jessica Alba), mostly keep to the periphery, maintaining a judicious distance from the movie’s soft, sticky center. That would be an excruciatingly lengthy meeting of Killers Anonymous, a support group for assassins modeled along the lines of A.A. Seated in a circle, six odious lowlifes recount their murderous memories while their leader, Joanna (MyAnna Buring), strives to control the free-floating hostility. As they yammer through meandering monologues featuring soy milk and the C.I.A., the director, Martin Owen, tarts up the tedium with stylized lighting and quirkily staged flashbacks. Cutaways to a character known only as The Man (Oldman) — a sort of universal sponsor — release us from the members’ solipsism, if not from our pain. Hopping between Los Angeles and London, “Killers Anonymous” forms an uneasy alliance between bloody deeds and a glib comedic tone set by Alba’s brief opening appearance as a killer lesbian. The vibe is faux-Tarantino and the inarticulate plot wonders which of our miscreants is responsible for the attempted assassination of a U.S. Senator. Was it the group’s newest member, meek little Alice (Rhyon Nicole Brown), who clearly has a secret? And who is the spy lurking outside the meeting? Unfortunately, the movie’s political underbelly feels as incoherent as its ludicrously violent conclusion. So while you might leave with several unanswered questions, the most concerning one is how this fiasco was ever financed in the first place. Killers Anonymous Rated R. It’s right there in the title, guys. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes."
110,Spider-Man: Far From Home,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/movies/spider-man-far-from-home-review.html,"I stan a pipsqueak. What I mean to say is that I like Peter Parker in “Spider-Man: Far From Home” for the same reason I liked Miles Morales in “Into the Spider-Verse”: he’s a teenager. In pop-culture years, the web-slinger is pushing 60, but his most recent movie incarnations have emphasized his youth. Tom Holland, the British actor who has played Spider-Man since 2016, recently turned 23, but he still plausibly looks and sounds like a 16-year-old New York City high school student. This is as it should be. The character’s perpetual youth is explained in the movie (or “in-universe,” as I guess we’re saying these days) by what happened in between the last two “Avengers” movies. You remember, right? No? I know, it’s been almost two months. Anyway, a lot of superheroes along with half of the living beings in the universe were vaporized by a purple-faced villain with a corrugated chin. This felt like a big deal at the time, but they were all brought back to life and the whole episode is now recalled as “the Blip.” The opening scenes of “Far From Home,” directed by Jon Watts from a script by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, recap that reversible apocalypse in brisk comic style, from the standpoint of Peter and his fellow students at Midtown High School. Peter is still living in Queens with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and still crushing hard on MJ (Zendaya). Everyone’s getting ready for the school trip to Europe. All’s right with the world until the next supervillain shows up. Which happens, of course. I’ll refrain from saying too much about him, but the bad guy’s motives are the usual mix of megalomaniacal diabolism and semi-legitimate grievance, but his explanation of the grudge he holds against the superheroes of the world exposes the movie’s major problem, which is Tony Stark. I know what you’re thinking: didn’t he die at the end of “Endgame”? Didn’t we all choke up when Happy (Jon Favreau, who shows up here to flirt with Aunt May) remembered how Tony liked cheeseburgers? Robert Downey Jr. is not in “Far From Home,” but his image pops up from time to time, and the Stark/Iron Man name and brand are invoked frequently. The scion of Stark Industries may be gone, but his cult of personality is stronger than ever. Fair enough, I suppose. The Marvel Cinematic Universe as we know it — don’t we know it!— got rolling more than a decade ago with “Iron Man,” directed by Favreau. But because of various corporate intellectual-property issues, Spider-Man, licensed to Sony by Marvel, didn’t at first mix with the Avengers, who are Disney guys. Apparently it was part of the deal that Spidey would be Iron Man’s sidekick. For most of “Far From Home” he still wears the yoke of apprenticeship, speaking reverently about “Mr. Stark” and wondering if he could possibly fill the shoes (or the high-tech sunglasses) of such a remarkable visionary. I thought we were starting to move past the breathless worship of narcissistic billionaire tech bros, but apparently not. Spidey’s nemesis used to work for Stark. His minions are a bunch of fellow ex-employees who complain about how Stark took credit for their work, ignored their best ideas and hogged the spotlight for himself. What a bunch of losers. Everyone knows bosses are meant to be idolized, figureheads of aspiration rather than objects of envy. It’s a good thing that Happy is still around with the Stark private jet, various branded doodads and a mouthful of libertarian-plutocratic talking points. Along with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), Happy is on hand to reinforce the corporate grandiosity that is the “Avengers” hallmark. Jake Gyllenhaal saunters in to keep things interesting and keep would-be spoiler-mongers on their toes. As is often the case with these movies, a smaller, livelier entertainment is nested inside the roaring, clanking digital machinery. The filmmakers try to enliven the big fights and action sequences by injecting a bit of self-consciousness about the illusion-driven craft they pursue, and a few sequences take place in an austere, dreamlike virtual realm where visually interesting things are allowed to happen. For a little while, anyway. The high-school comedy bits of “Far From Home,” while not especially original, have a sweet, affable charm. JB Smoove and Martin Starr are funny as the hapless teachers guiding a squad of teens through Venice, Prague and London. Jacob Batalon and Angourie Rice are delightful as Peter and MJ’s teen-movie best friends, who abruptly fall in love.  Will that happen for Peter, too? The freshest parts of the story revisit some of the character’s longest-standing issues, as Peter struggles with the competing demands of normal adolescence and superheroism. This isn’t just about the great responsibility that comes with great power, but about figuring out who or what you’re responsible for. Peter’s loyalty to his friends — a sweet, spirited crew embodying the tolerance, skepticism and earnestness that characterize their generation, as well as some of its less appealing aspects — is sometimes at odds with his vocation. You wish he could have some time off. Of course that isn’t in the cards. “Spider-Man: Far From Home” ends with the usual mid- and post-credits kickers that are meant to be surprising but are really the opposite. Spoiler alert: there are a lot more movies like this coming. In the meantime, enjoy the Blip. Spider-Man: Far From Home Rated PG-13. Great cities in ruins. Running time: 2 hours 9 minutes."
112,Midsommar,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/movies/midsommar-review.html,"We horror-movie lovers are cheap dates. A creaking door and a shocking edit can be all it takes for us to yelp in surrender, as our sympathetic nervous systems kick in and we grab our seat arms or each other. Ari Aster, who made a splash last summer with his feature directing debut, “Hereditary,” understands the genre’s fundamentals. But his strength in that movie and his new one, “Midsommar,” is the setup, that part when he lays out his characters, their worlds and the menace that closes on them like a claw. A cautionary tale about bad relationships and worse vacations, “Midsommar” gets its creep on early. When it opens, Dani (Florence Pugh), its deeply troubled axis, is having a lousy day that rapidly turns devastating. Her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor), who’s on the verge of breaking up with her, isn’t much help, though he eventually comes through. Months later Dani is still having a rough time while Christian continues eyeing the closest exit. Their uneasy dynamic intensifies and changes during a catastrophic trip to a small, strange community in Sweden, where the expected summertime fun gives way to terror. Aster handles the windup shrewdly with a persuasive realism, a deliberate pace and crepuscular lighting. Notably, he also sets Dani’s solitary tears and all of her feelings against the solidarity that Christian shares with his buds. The guys don’t make sense as friends, which scarcely matters at that point. Aster banks on the suspension of disbelief, which is part of the delicate compact we make with horror movies. When one bro, Mark (Will Poulter), starts running down Dani, you can almost see the expiration date on his forehead. As with much in this hyper-aware movie, Mark fits the role he was created to play by motor-mouthing his way into a narratively justified demise. The stateside stuff drags (the movie runs two hours, 20 minutes) but when the story shifts to Sweden, everything changes, including the light. With his estimable crew — the cinematographer is Pawel Pogorzelski, the production designer is Henrik Svensson — Aster creates a sun-blasted, open-plan settlement that conveys airiness, back-to-the-land self-reliance and other assorted healthy things. There’s something odd about the smattering of buildings, which are too off-kilter to pass as charming; there are too few shadows and corners to hide in. The same goes for all the smiling white people in their pretty folk costumes. They’re so welcoming, yet so vacant. If this were a Jordan Peele freakout, someone might have a clue. Someone else might be hurriedly packing a bag. But, as Aster established in “Hereditary,” his interest rests largely on building an elaborate mousetrap. From the moment Dani, Christian and the rest pass through the settlement’s sunburst gate, everything from the green hills girdling the compound to the flowing choreography contributes to the slow-growing, inexorable sense of entrapment. By the time a few dozen women are dancing in circles around a maypole, even the camerawork — with its sinuous flow and contrapuntal push-ins and pullouts — seems to be tightening its grip on the visitors. It’s fun, at first, partly because something feels distinctly off, like milk that’s just gone bad. (You don’t know how bad until you taste it.) Christian’s Swedish friend Pelle (Vilhelm Blomgren) doesn’t offer any clues. So Christian, Mark and their not-brainy enough pal Josh (William Jackson Harper) scope out the scene and the locals. The women are friendly, and numerous. And while their dances look picturesque there’s an undercurrent of intensity and purpose that starts chipping away at the peaceful vibe. [Read about the new wave of horror movies centered on family dread.] After a while, an unproductive restlessness sets in as you wait for the characters to matter as much as the silky moves and painstaking details. Horror depends on the spectacle of human frailties, on the good and foolish choices that bridge the distance between the viewer and the screen (or blow it to smithereens). But when characters are as stupid as the visitors in “Midsommar,” it only encourages your sadism, which is presumably the point. Aster clearly worships at the altar of Stanley Kubrick (a hexagonal design here is right out of the Overlook Hotel collection), and he seems too meticulous to let avoidable mistakes — risible lapses in logic — happen without reason. Unlike Kubrick or Peele, though, Aster isn’t interested in psychological complexities that can make a character’s terminal fate meaningful and turn directorial virtuosity into vision. Despite all the time he lavishes on Dani and Christian’s relationship, which is drawn along stereotypical gendered lines (consuming female need that becomes devouring), the couple remains instructively uninteresting. That’s the case despite Pugh. She works hard to make Dani into more than a walking wound, but again and again, the character betrays both her common sense and your faith, all so the women can dance, the men howl and the maypole can hook up with ye old vagina dentata. Midsommar Rated R for grisly Viking-style torture and other gruesome spectacles. In English and Swedish, with English subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 20 minutes."
113,Stuber,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/movies/stuber-review.html,"Every so often, a movie opens that you’re sure you and some friends plotted out on a bar napkin once upon a late night. You know that bigger-than-life picture: It’s the movie-I’ll-never-make fantasy, the get-rich-flick scheme that you are positive someone with money will eventually produce. Because someone with money is always making a movie like “Stuber,” an entertainment that is at once knowingly derivative (it’s like “Lethal Weapon”!) and somehow just different enough (with ride sharing!). A breezily violent two-hander and a dubious feature-length commercial for Uber, “Stuber” is about two guys who meet cute, kill people and bond. It’s one of those dumb movies that are so gleeful about their own idiocy that taking it seriously may seem pointless, which is always a good reason to take a movie seriously. “Stuber” is certainly worth a thought or two for how it fits into the tradition of buddy action movies, those bromances with bullets that include “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “48 Hrs.,” “Bad Boys,” “Rush Hour,” “21 Jump Street” and so forth, ad infinitum. While this subgenre has slightly changed over time — with somewhat diversified casting, as here — the focus on the preservation (veneration) of heterosexual male intimacy remains constant. That’s the case in “Stuber,” which centers on Stu (Kumail Nanjiani), a sweetly beleaguered Los Angeles Uber driver with an aspirational “FIVESTAR” vanity plate. One day, he picks up Vic (Dave Bautista), a police detective who, on the same day that he’s had eye surgery, gets a tip on a killer (Iko Uwais). Since Vic can’t drive, he summons an Uber, thus initiating the latest high-concept duet. Written by Tripper Clancy and directed by Michael Dowse, “Stuber” squeaks by on the charm of its two male stars, who handle the nonsense capably. Bautista steam-rolls through both the frame and the dialogue, but he’s a natural, magnetic physical presence — a nimble hulk — and fun to watch. He’s comfortable sharing the screen with, and being routinely upstaged by, Nanjiani, who’s more adept at making the cheap goods feel less insultingly formulaic. With sidelong looks, leaping eyebrows and unpredictable line readings that invariably personalize the material (he’s as breathy as Marilyn Monroe), Nanjiani transforms a cliché into something resembling a person. The story is as ridiculous as the setup and largely involves Vic and Stu learning how to care and share while chasing down the killer as their strained meet-cute mellows into a full-blown homosocial love-in. Amid the gunfire, spilled blood and cutesy macho posturing there are predictable turns, adorable pups, ethnic stereotypes and a few class-conscious touches (Vic’s apartment, Stu’s main gig). Also notable are the various women who embody challenges that the men must surmount together: Stu’s often-teasing, cruelly elusive crush (Betty Gilpin); Vic’s warmly loving artist daughter (the appealing Natalie Morales); and Vic’s hard-charging boss (Mira Sorvino). There’s another woman in the mix, too, a murdered cop (Karen Gillan), who dies soon after “Stuber” opens. She isn’t around long enough to really register, but her end is ugly, repellent in its unthinking lack of gravity and in its narrative functionality. The death jolts the movie, giving it instantly recognizable stakes; more specifically, it gives Vic something interesting, a tragedy that becomes his principal purpose. In death, she enriches his life, and that’s what makes her a character. Just as important, the dead cop — like every other significant woman in “Stuber” — serves as a test for our two heroes, a hurdle they must clear in order to find themselves, or, rather, each other. Stuber Rated R for extreme gun violence and the usual bloody action-movie violence. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes."
115,Point Blank,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/movies/review-point-blank.html,"If your cinematic wish list includes watching a steel-faced Marcia Gay Harden blast a big guy named Cheetah with a shotgun, then by all means, check out “Point Blank.” Anybody outside of this niche constituency can skip this flaccid Netflix action flick — including fans of Anthony Mackie and Frank Grillo, who ill-advisedly used their vacation from playing Falcon and Crossbones in Marvel movies. Directed by Joe Lynch, the film attempts to graft buddy-comedy antics onto a “we’re running out of time!” plot. Mackie’s Paul is a nurse desperately trying to rescue his very pregnant wife, Taryn (Teyonah Parris), who was abducted for contrived reasons having to do with Grillo’s character, Abe, a tough guy who may not be as bad as he first appears. There is also something to do with police corruption, which, in case you were wondering, is where Harden comes in. Paul and Abe find themselves in increasingly ludicrous situations, culminating in an encounter with a diminutive kingpin (Markice Moore) whose dominant trait is an acute case of cinephilia: “It’s Friedkin week on TCM,” he announces at one point, bringing up a director who, unlike Lynch, knows what to do with a camera. The movie starts off promisingly enough, if only because Mackie is a naturally compelling performer. It’s not long before alarm bells go off — especially when a fight in a carwash is set to the Oran “Juice” Jones song “The Rain,” the first in a series of distractingly preposterous soundtrack selections pulled from what sounds like a “Now That’s What I Call the ’80s” compilation. If anything, the film emanates a startling ineptitude, unable as it is to clear some basic standards of craftsmanship. If a plot about a male nurse and his kidnapped, pregnant spouse feels vaguely familiar to connoisseurs of B movies, it’s because “Point Blank” is a remake of a much superior, lean-and-mean French offering from 2011. But even that one is no threat to John Boorman’s 1967 noir experiment in the competition for best “Point Blank” ever. Point Blank Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes."
116,The Farewell,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/movies/the-farewell-review.html,"“The Farewell,” Lulu Wang’s second feature, conjures a premise so rich with potential comedy, heartbreak and family weirdness that it can only have come from real life. Which it did, via an episode of “This American Life” that first aired in 2016. The film version, which announces itself as “based on an actual lie,” has a loose, anecdotal structure and a tone that balances candor and tact. Much of the charm and power of this story — about events leading up to a wedding that’s also a fake funeral of sorts — come from the palpable sense that it genuinely happened to someone. [Read about Lulu Wang’s real-life story of love and deception.] The fictionalized version of that someone (in other words of Wang herself) is Billi (Awkwafina), a struggling, artistically minded New Yorker who emigrated from China with her parents as a young child. In some ways, Billi is closer to her grandmother (Zhao Shuzhen), who lives in the northern Chinese city of Changchun and speaks no English, than to her own mother (Diana Lin) or father (Tzi Ma). Nai Nai (Mandarin for “grandma”), always available for warm, easygoing cellphone chats, is a funny, candid, lively presence compared to Billi’s parents, who often seem weary, anxious and impatient. They have worked hard and sacrificed so much to give their daughter access to the American middle class, as they don’t hesitate to remind her. It’s a complicated inheritance, to understate the matter. At times, the competing demands of filial duty, individual ambition and cultural identity that Billi faces seem overwhelming. Not that “The Farewell” is all about her. Billi’s identity crisis comes into view as the side effect of a larger and graver situation. Nai Nai, who has a persistent cough, receives a grim diagnosis. Or, rather, her younger sister (Lu Hong), who accompanies Nai Nai to her medical appointment, hears the bad news and decides to tell everyone in the family except Nai Nai, who may have only a few months to live. A party is planned, at which Billi’s cousin, who grew up mostly in Japan, will marry his girlfriend. The real purpose is to gather the clan to pay respects to the dying matriarch, though no one is supposed to shed a tear or mention her illness. Billi is bothered by the secrecy, both because it seems unethical to withhold information from a patient and because it means that she must counterfeit her own feelings, suppressing her grief in favor of forced joy. Wang turns her frustration and bewilderment into a gentle exploration of the cultural differences and generational schisms that have, over the years, opened up within Nai Nai’s extended family. Some relatives offer simple ways of explaining these divides. In America, Billi is told, the emphasis is on the individual, whereas in China family and community always come first. It’s probably not the first time she has heard something like that, and “The Farewell,” like Billi, treats such conventional wisdom with respectful skepticism. Families, communities and individuals aren’t easily summed up in a few catchphrases, and life is rarely a matter of choosing sides. But there is also something hesitant about the way Wang turns this beguiling family story into a film, an unwillingness to push too hard into potentially painful emotional territory, which also keeps the comedy in check. A tearful confrontation between Billi and her mother, rather than bringing hard issues into the open, buries them in overscripted speeches. Aside from the irrepressible Nai Nai, who gets all of the good lines and most of the best camera angles, the other family members are thinly drawn. That includes Billi herself, whose life outside the family is barely sketched in and whose inner life rarely emerges into view. Awkwafina, a charismatic music-video star and a strong comic presence in “Crazy Rich Asians,” vanishes into Billi’s moods rather than illuminating them. Her performance seems cautious and defended in a way that characterizes “The Farewell” as a whole. Its affection for its characters feels protective; the film is reluctant to spill any secrets or cause any embarrassment. There is admirable kindness and impressive loyalty in this approach, but it also puts a bit of a damper on the party. Wang appeals to the audience’s tact and good will, counting on our acceptance that some things are none of our business. A version of the impulse that keeps Nai Nai in the dark about her condition hovers over the party, keeping the guests at a distance and the festivities carefully under control. The Farewell Rated PG. A few hard feelings. In English and Mandarin, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 38 minutes."
118,The Lion King,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/movies/the-lion-king-review.html,"Watching the newest version of “The Lion King” — a big-screen celebrity-voiced musical trying its best to look like a television nature documentary — I recalled a line from John Gregory Dunne’s 1969 book “The Studio” that may be my all-time favorite sentence in the annals of movie writing. “Six months were devoted to teaching Chee Chee the Chimpanzee how to cook bacon and eggs,” Dunne wrote, referring to a character in “Doctor Dolittle,” one of many real animals cast in that big-budget, family-friendly musical spectacle. Dunne was pounding the pavement on the 20th Century Fox lot at a time of political tension and social fracture, when the Hollywood studios seemed to be facing an existential crisis. Pretty much like now, in other words, except that the money and ingenuity those studios used to spend on things like teaching chimps to make breakfast now go toward turning lines of code into fur and sinew. This is undoubtedly an ethical improvement, much as Chee Chee may have enjoyed hanging out with Rex Harrison. The hope behind this “Lion King,” opening July 19, is that advancing digital technology will also enhance the luster of the moviegoing experience. It does and it doesn’t. There are a great many impressive moments in this film, and a few that might elicit a gasp of amazement or an appreciative burst of laughter from even a jaded viewer. For example: When Pumbaa, the flatulent warthog voiced by Seth Rogen, absent-mindedly scratches his left ear with his hind leg, I confess that I nearly wept. Not because the scene was especially touching or sad, but because of the sheer extravagant craft that had clearly gone into rendering those two seconds of reflexive animal behavior. I was nearly as moved by the efforts of a dung beetle to propel a ball of scat across a patch of desert. The digital artisans responsible for these images didn’t necessarily have to do it all with such fanatical care, and the fact that they did is surely worthy of admiration. So if a movie could be judged solely on technique, “The Lion King” might qualify as a great one. And it kind of wants to be judged that way — for its technical skin rather than its dramatic soul. The opening sequence (it doesn’t seem right to call it a “shot”) fools the eye in subtle and brazen ways. You might think there are real creatures mixed into the computer-generated menagerie (there aren’t), but at the same time the flights of animal choreography lie beyond the skill of any trainer. Then the music starts, and it’s “The Circle of Life” and baby Simba is cute enough to make all the trolls on Twitter go awwwww. The mixture of coziness and, well, awe in that opening number is as on-brand as anything Disney has done since — I guess since a few weeks ago, when it released “Toy Story 4.” Once the voices start up, we are in a comfortable and familiar pop-cultural space, even if the talking beasts don’t look much like cartoons. (A possible exception might be Zazu, the hornbill who sounds like John Oliver. Or maybe it’s just that John Oliver looks like a hornbill.) The antelopes lope. The elephants lumber. The graceful lions bask in their languorous power, lolling and growling and setting up the parameters of the story. Not many surprises there. Simba’s father, Mufasa (James Earl Jones), rules the savanna with a gentle paw and a loyal queen, Sarabi (Alfre Woodard). Mufasa’s brother, Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor), is the snake in this garden, scheming first to kill Simba, the rightful heir to the throne, and then to get rid of Mufasa. Scar has the help of Shenzi (Florence Kasumba) and her army of hyenas, whose closed-up, predatory faces are genuinely scary, especially when they appear for the first time. Small children may have some trouble at that point, and also with Scar’s ruthless political machinations, which are pretty murdery for Disney. But it’s likely that much of the audience, young and old, will have some familiarity with the narrative, whether from the 1994 animated feature or from the long-running, much-loved Broadway show. “The Lion King” currently under review isn’t meant to replace or outdo either of those, but rather to multiply revenue streams and use a beloved property to show off some new tricks. A lot of people will go, expecting to like what they see, and for the most part they won’t be disappointed. I said earlier that the movie, which was directed by Jon Favreau and written by Jeff Nathanson, looks like a nature documentary. But it plays more like an especially glitzy presentation reel at a trade convention, with popular songs and high-end talent pushing an exciting new product that nobody is sure quite how to use. Simba and his best friend, Nala, voiced as cubs by JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph, grow up into Donald Glover and Beyoncé, and when they get going on “Can You Feel the Love Tonight …” It’s O.K. When Pumbaa and his pal Timon the meerkat show up — I’m not going to stir up trouble by saying which one might be the other’s sidekick — we get a brisk vaudevillian double act from Rogen and Billy Eichner. That’s O.K. too. But of all the second-golden-age Disney animated features, the original “Lion King” is the most Shakespearean, as well as being the most ideologically coherent Hollywood defense of monarchy until “Black Panther.” The grandeur and intimacy, the earthy humor and heavenly songs have given it gravity and staying power. Those are somehow missing here. The songs don’t have the pop or the splendor. The terror and wonder of the intra-pride battles are muted. There is a lot of professionalism but not much heart. It may be that the realism of the animals makes it hard to connect with them as characters, undermining the inspired anthropomorphism that has been the most enduring source of Disney magic. Real lions don’t sing — not even like Beyoncé — and don’t actually govern other creatures. The closer the movie gets to nature in its look, the more blatant, intrusive and purposeless its artifice seems. It might have worked better without songs or dialogue: surely the Disney wizards could have figured out how to spin an epic tale of royal succession and self-discovery through purely visual means. Or else someone could have spent a few months teaching the digital Pumbaa to whip up a nice tofu scramble. The Lion King Rated PG. Not too red in tooth and claw. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes."
120,Skin,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/movies/knives-and-skin-review.html,"It is manifestly unfair to compare the work of a near-universally admired auteur to an odd, ambitious independent film, but “Knives and Skin” owes so much to David Lynch, particularly “Twin Peaks,” that it feels wrong to pretend it exists in a vacuum. The ingredients are similar enough to be distracting: dead (or at least presumed dead) teenage ingénue; moody jock; tenderhearted sheriff; a 1950s-style waitress; affectless line readings; scoring that resembles Angelo Badalamenti’s “Mysteries of Love” from “Blue Velvet.” Add these together, and they give the impression of a secondhand sensibility, as if the writer-director, Jennifer Reeder, a visual artist who has turned to narrative cinema, were exorcising another filmmaker’s demons rather than her own. That is unfortunate, because there is genuine eeriness here, and Reeder makes distinctive use of color and music. The plot pivots on the disappearance of Carolyn (Raven Whitley), an outwardly wholesome blonde from the high school marching band with a secret after-hours life. She goes missing after a marshland tryst with Andy (Ty Olwin) ends badly. Her mother, Lisa (Marika Engelhardt), the director of the school choir, loses what remains of her mind, and the search for Carolyn lays bare the small town’s frustrations and perversities. The best scenes stand apart from the shaggy-dog mystery, as when the chorus rehearses an a cappella rendition of the New Order song “Blue Monday” while its members secretly converse, their words rendered in subtitles. The interlude is strangely haunting in its simplicity, a stark contrast to the film’s more overt bids at weirdness — Lisa becomes intimate with Andy after smelling Carolyn’s scent in his car — which can be simply grotesque. Knives and Skin Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 51 minutes."
122,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/movies/fast-and-furious-presents-hobbs-and-shaw-review.html,"The people who made “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw” know that Dwayne Johnson (Luke Hobbs) and Jason Statham (Deckard Shaw) have an easy adversarial chemistry. They build the movie around their put-downs and pranks. Statham stays focused on how Johnson’s size makes him seem kind of dumb and unsubtle. And Johnson picks on what an indecipherably British hobbit Statham is. At some point, Hobbs gets a load of Shaw’s stable of sports cars and asks if he’s, uh, overcompensating. Seems right for two people — an American agent and an English mercenary — who spent an exciting sequence at the top of the seventh “Fast & Furious” movie throwing each other through glass windows and designer office furniture. This spinoff is more of the same. But, written by Chris Morgan, who’s handled most of the “Fast & Furious” movies, and Drew Pearce, it weighs less and seems to know that, too. David Leitch directed it, and the fights and chases achieve a kind of smooth brutality that makes sense for the maker of “Atomic Blonde” and the second “Deadpool” and who had a hand in the first “John Wick.” It has a good hip-hop soundtrack and the sort of coherent editing that you need for something with this much juxtaposed bone-breaking. The weightlessness, however, extends to a plot that makes no sense, and involves an extinction-level virus that Shaw’s intelligence-agent sister, Hattie (Vanessa Kirby), has heroically injected into herself and that doesn’t at all diminish her agility, wit or capacity for flirtation. The filmmakers so want to maintain the joshing between Johnson and Statham that the movie’s ostensible action label and the lust Shaw fears Hobbs has for his sister feel like pretexts for the romantic comedy “Hobbs & Shaw” virtually is.  Idris Elba plays the movie’s biomechanically enhanced supervillain, and not that far into things, he wonders aloud who’s going to stop him. So, for an answer, there’s a cut to a split screen of Johnson and Statham in their respective beds. Each is going about his day — waking up, eating, exercising, taking phone calls simultaneously with the exact same response. “Jinx!” I thought to myself. With the screen split, their bald heads — Johnson’s is smooth, Statham’s stubbled — are often inches from each other. And over the course of the movie, the tension between these two has so escalated amid the downpour of virility that by the time they’re on a plane arguing, again, over the sister (“I’m gonna let her climb this mountain. Over. And over”) those bald heads are all but knocking into each other. I was torn. Was the right response, “Get a room” or “Here’s a scrotum”? It’s serious enough between them that anytime the movie presents alternative partnerships in the form of cameos by other, more naturally funny male stars, Hobbs and Shaw decline. This relationship is closed! And that gives a ridiculous sensuality to the climactic three-way beat-down and the way the frame speed decelerates enough for every punched face and kicked head to seem like a caress, as if they were Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze at her pottery wheel in “Ghost.” None of that makes “Hobbs & Shaw” better. It doesn’t save the movie from a saggy setup for the showdown, in Samoa, between Elba’s anonymous paramilitary goons and Hobbs’s mostly anonymous Samoan family.  Estrangement is the movie’s big theme — Shaw hasn’t seen his sister in ages, and Hobbs swore he’d never go back to that island (meaning his smart 9-year-old daughter has never met her formidable grandmother). The movie doesn’t care about the strains in these relationships, so why strain them? Nothing changes if Hobbs and his brother (Cliff Curtis) are on good speaking terms. They’d still assemble dozens of their siblings and cousins for the finale’s assorted phases. They’d still figure out how to affix a bunch of trucks to a flying chopper. It’s just more pretext. The whole thing just makes me miss how horny and violent movies used to be. Here, all the violence is sex. Only, it’s not. It’s just winking. That chastity is a quiet lament in the buddy movie likely to be playing across the hall from this one, Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.”  That film has a lot to mourn, including the idea that sex has gone out of the movies. At some point, Tarantino shows us a coming attraction for Joe Namath and Ann-Margret in “C.C. and Company,” a loud, dumb, fun motorcycle romp from 1970 in which all Namath does is tussle, drive and, with her, fool around. A movie like that portended 20 years of action-thrillers that also had a libido. The women didn’t always fare well, but nobody feared sex. That was as omnipresent as smoking and guns.  We don’t believe in the sex anymore. All we’ve got now is the guns. When “Hobbs & Shaw” whisks everybody to a Moscow mansion stocked with sexy thieves and Shaw walks in and plants one right on the ringleader (Eiza González), Hobbs and the sister look on in horror. We’re grossed out, too. He is overcompensating. Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw Rated PG-13. Kicking, shooting and punching — but the harmless, bloodless cartoon kind. Running time: 2 hours 15 minutes. "
123,A Score to Settle,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/movies/a-score-to-settle-review.html,"Nicolas Cage’s singing voice might not be the worst thing about the revenge thriller “A Score to Settle,” but it’s right up there with Clint Eastwood’s woodland warblings in “Paint Your Wagon” (1969). I could happily have gone to the grave without hearing either. Which is exactly where Frank Carver (Cage), the onetime enforcer for an Oregon crime syndicate, is headed. A diagnosis of sporadic fatal insomnia has earned him early release from prison after serving 19 years for a murder he didn’t commit. Now he has two goals: to make amends to his troubled son, Joey (a colorless Noah Le Gros), and to track down and punish the surviving members of his former crew. The reason for this vendetta is not immediately clear, but that’s par for the course in a movie that leaves a great deal unexplained until the final half-hour. Until then, “A Score to Settle” takes a strange, intermittently violent and digressive trip alongside a dying man of dubious mental clarity — in other words, the kind of role that’s bang in Cage’s wheelhouse. Less comfortable is his director, Shawn Ku (whose last big-screen feature, “Beautiful Boy,” was almost 10 years ago), who struggles to match his star’s surrender to a story that seems to have little idea where it’s going. While Joey inexplicably appears and disappears at random, his increasingly addled father, bedeviled by flashbacks to his younger self (played by Cage’s spitting-image nephew, Bailey Coppola), gets medieval on a succession of former associates. Conversations about baseball bats and the benefits of applying vitamin E to gunshot scars interrupt the action; but not even John Newman’s distressingly awful dialogue can slow Cage’s roll to a histrionic finish. Or a wistful chorus of “I’m always chasing rainbows.” A Score to Settle Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 43 minutes."
125,Dora and the Lost City of Gold,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/movies/dora-and-the-lost-city-of-gold-review.html,"If you think it’s odd that Nickelodeon’s animated naturalist tyke Dora the Explorer is a teenager in the new live-action adaptation of her exploits, don’t worry, the film does, too. The most charming moments of “Dora and the Lost City of Gold” come in its first half, as the 16-year-old title character (Isabela Moner), forced to live with relatives while her parents are off on a dangerous new adventure, tries to adapt to life in the suburbs and at high school. There, her unique background, relentless cheer and wide-eyed inquisitiveness prompt strange looks, as she sets off metal detectors with the heavy-duty contents of her jungle survival kit, congratulates the cafeteria staff on a fine lunch, and grills a girl trying to “save the rain forest” about which rain forests, exactly, she’s trying to save. For the school’s winter dance, students are encouraged to go as their favorite star; while everyone else comes dressed as soccer players, pop singers and movie actors, Dora naturally arrives as the sun and proceeds to do an adorably goofy dance. Even her cousin, onetime fellow explorer Diego (Jeff Wahlberg), turns on her at this point. A cruel nickname emerges among the kids: Dorka. “Dora and the Lost City of Gold” is not a satire, however, nor is it an attempt to crossbreed Nickelodeon’s popular bilingual character, who made her first TV appearance in 2000, with “Mean Girls.” Even as it strikes a gently irreverent tone, the film also embodies its heroine’s positive energy: We understand that the world would be a better place if the rest of us were more like Dora, not the other way around. She soon gets a chance to prove her mettle when she and three fellow students are abducted by treasure hunters trying to track down Dora’s parents (Michael Peña and Eva Longoria), who are searching for a lost Incan city of gold named Parapata. The Indiana Jones-style high jinks that ensue don’t quite have the visual verve or breakneck pacing of a “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” or even a “National Treasure,” but they’re invigorated by the film’s cheekiness. Dora has to help a clueless classmate dig a “poo hole” in the jungle. Later, the kids are intoxicated by giant spores and hallucinate that they’ve become animated versions of themselves. There are jokes about neurotoxicity and dysentery. Somehow, it all works. That’s because the film’s freewheeling, what-if quality never becomes meanspirited or gross. The director James Bobin (who achieved a similarly good-natured silliness with his 2011 reboot of “The Muppets”) has a casual style that serves the material well: Nothing is ever too urgent or too lackadaisical. This is a deceptively tough balancing act. Get too loose and the movie will turn into a bunch of limp comedy sketches; get too realistic, and it will lose any sense of what makes Dora such a beloved and timeless character. Like a child unwittingly navigating a jungle full of booby traps and deadly creatures, the film walks a treacherously fine line without ever seeming to break a sweat. Dora and the Lost City of GoldRated PG for mild jungle action and a cavalier attitude toward inflammatory bowel diseases. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes. "
126,The Kitchen,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/movies/review-the-kitchen.html,"An offense against feminism, narrative logic and Fleetwood Mac, “The Kitchen” is a terrible, witless mess. Set in New York in the late 1970s, it spins a pandering story about three wallflower wives — played by Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish and Elisabeth Moss — who transform into crime bosses after their gangster husbands are sent up the river. The laughable setup becomes progressively worse the more the movie tries to spin their metamorphosis as female empowerment, a road to liberation that’s blithely paved with wads of cash, hollow laughs and corpses. McCarthy plays Kathy, the wife of a low-level member of an Irish-American gang that controls Hell’s Kitchen, back in the not remotely good old days before gentrification. The movie’s sentimental favorite, Kathy has worried eyes, two kids and a dumb-cluck husband who, soon after the story begins, botches a holdup with two thug confederates. Left without their family paychecks, Kathy and the other men’s wives, Ruby (Haddish) and Claire (Moss), turn to crime to make ends meet. At first, they timidly shake down grateful businesses for protection money, but soon are making deals with the Italian mob and overseeing a psycho butchering a body.  The whole thing is as absurd as it is dubiously aspirational, and proves a bad fit for the writer-director Andrea Berloff. The Westies, the model for the gang, were a notoriously brutal bunch that had a thing for chopping up their victims; here, they’re mostly bad husbands, inept criminals, routine creeps. (The movie was adapted from a graphic novel.) The three women turn out to be more capable mobsters. Even so, when it comes to violence, they hand off some of their uglier business to a crazed associate (a persuasively dead-eyed Domhnall Gleeson), a move that — as with a discreet bathtub dismemberment — attenuates the horror of their violence and their complicity. There’s so much that’s wrong here, including a lot of the music (Fleetwood Mac!); the confused tones; the disjointed, presumably triage editing; the carefully littered mean streets; the nods to women’s lib. But the biggest problem is that Berloff won’t commit to the villainy — the greed and bloodletting — of her main characters. It’s amusing, at first, to see how they take to crime after their husbands are out of the picture, partly because the leads are appealing and Berloff gives each time to do her thing. Moss, an ace weeper, cries a few rivers. McCarthy bares some soul. Haddish eases into affecting stillness. (Bill Camp, as a silky Mafioso, slinks off with his scenes.) Yet the more successful the women become — the more corrupt and flagrantly cruel — the more Berloff tries to rationalize their actions on feminist grounds, which she does by overloading the movie with stereotyped victimization and flag-waving. All three have been oppressed in some way. Kathy has long been a dutiful wife and daughter. Ruby implausibly married into a bullying, racist family. And Claire, who’s first seen with blood streaking her face, has lived with her abuser for years. The three break out of their birdcages energetically and with fantastical ease, finding themselves through the rapacious exploitation of other people. They lean in with a vengeance. If the women did so unapologetically, staying true to the corrupt course that they set for themselves, “The Kitchen” might have worked, maybe, or at least not felt like such a cop-out. For all their gory deeds and tough words, though, Kathy and her pals are never allowed to be sincerely and thoroughly bad — and as richly complex and contradictory and human — as any memorable male gangster or one of the more righteous heroines from the Roger Corman exploitation-cinema catalog. Instead, like many ill-behaved Hollywood characters, the women of “The Kitchen” pay a price for their criminality, but with a contemporary twist: They are punished with virtue. The Kitchen Rated R for gun and knife violence. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes."
127,The Art of Racing in the Rain,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/movies/the-art-of-racing-in-the-rain-review.html,"At first glance, the feeble tear-jerker “The Art of Racing in the Rain” seems to be a movie made for dog lovers. It is told from the perspective of a dog, a beautiful if inexpressive golden retriever named Enzo. But in a twist that undermines the simple-minded sweetness that makes dogs (and dog movies) so appealing, Enzo is not like other pups. He thinks like a person — pondering subjects like death and reincarnation — and he also dreams of being human. The movie begins when Enzo is already long in the tooth and speaking with the gravelly monotone of Kevin Costner. Narrating his life story in retrospect, Enzo recalls being adopted as a puppy by a racecar driver named Denny (Milo Ventimiglia). As Denny’s companion, Enzo has borne loyal witness to his master’s life, and the film observes Denny through Enzo’s adoring eyes. Enzo is by Denny’s side as he falls in love and marries a kindly teacher, Eve (Amanda Seyfried), and he is steadfast when Denny’s domestic bliss is tested by illness and in-laws. Through it all, Enzo longs to guide Denny with words as humans do. Although Enzo claims to hold people in high regard, there’s no one in Denny’s life he deems a more worthy counselor than himself. It’s this moral superiority obtained from two feet above the ground that makes Enzo — and the film that indulges this conceit — so intolerable. He’s a scold, a snob and a suck-up all at once. Yet the treacly script valorizes Enzo, and the director, Simon Curtis, submits to it, trusting that the audience will want to see man’s best friend presented in such an earnest fashion. But Enzo is a bad dog, and his antics play worse for the film’s lack of discipline. The Art of Racing in the Rain Rated PG for bathroom humor and references to cancer. Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes. "
128,Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/movies/scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-review.html,"If Alvin Schwartz’s popular “Scary Stories” children’s books condensed folklore into an accessible anthology form, “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark,” an agreeable bit of fan service, performs a similar gateway function for movies. Whether it’s the scene-setting blast of Donovan (“Zodiac”), the low-height Steadicam work (“The Shining”), the red-suffused hallways (David Lynch) or “Night of the Living Dead” playing at a drive-in, the movie takes from the best. [Read how “Scary Stories” gave a future horror author nightmares.] The nostalgia is presumably the signature of Guillermo del Toro, who produced it. Like “The Shape of Water,” which he directed (André Ovredal did that job here), “Scary Stories” spikes its tributes with social commentary. The movie is set in 1968, more than a decade before the first book was published. The ghosts of Vietnam haunt the periphery, and Nixon’s election coincides with a gangly goblin’s arrival. Schwartz’s tales have been woven into a cohesive narrative (and there are nods to others that haven’t been filmed) with a simple device. The main characters — an aspiring writer, Stella (Zoe Colletti); her sidekicks (Gabriel Rush and Austin Zajur); and a newcomer to their small town (Michael Garza) — snatch a book from a haunted house. The tome once belonged to a pariah kept prisoner by her family. Ovredal respects the original illustrations of Stephen Gammell, whose hand is visible in the grotesquely contorted expressions of a scarecrow and in a trollish woman with a face like papier-mâché. (The closing credits list a collection of sculptors and modelers.) Ovredal pays less heed to an unofficial corollary to the Chekhov’s gun rule: If a spider has laid eggs in a girl’s cheek, and the girl is in a school production of “Bye Bye Birdie,” that boil needs to pop during a musical number. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark Rated PG-13 for creepy crawlies. Running time: 1 hour 51 minutes. "
129,The Peanut Butter Falcon,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/movies/the-peanut-butter-falcon-review.html,"This movie is rife with name actors: Dakota Johnson, Bruce Dern, John Hawkes, Shia LaBeouf, Thomas Haden Church. But its writer-directors, Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, conceived and executed it as a vehicle for a performer making his debut as a lead actor. Zack Gottsagen plays Zak, a young man with no family who lives in an old-age home in North Carolina. Zak has Down syndrome, and while the state has deemed that he needs constant care, there’s no appropriately specialized facility available to him. So he stays with some feisty seniors, several of whom he’s befriended. Those pals help him plan escapes, most of which fail. But one finally succeeds, and off Zak goes, wearing nothing but white briefs. He’s in search of a wrestling school run by a figure known as the Salt Water Redneck. Zak’s main caretaker, a volunteer named Eleanor (Johnson), is understandably appalled by this development. Zak’s subsequent adventure is a picaresque-humanist one, filled with relatively commonplace plot turns. He hides out in a boat owned by Tyler (LaBeouf), a hard-up fisherman still mourning the death of his older brother (Jon Bernthal in flashbacks) and making trouble with the local crab men, who will soon seek violent payback. Will Tyler find a new brother in Zak? Will Zak finally get into the ring, care of the Salt Water Redneck, and introduce his own wrestling persona, the Peanut Butter Falcon? (There are cameos from real-life wrestlers Mick Foley and Jake Roberts, albeit in mufti.). The clichés in this movie are enacted in a good cause. Gottsagen, who is in his early 30s, has Down syndrome himself and the filmmakers crafted “The Peanut Butter Falcon” specifically for him. Zak takes frequent pratfalls and is often seen in various un-self-conscious states of undress, but the movie never makes him a figure of fun. Neither, by the same token, does it try to wrench sentimental tears out of his condition. They make his character a little guy with a big heart, and big dreams — you’ve heard of such figures, I suppose — and let him have his hero’s journey. Which is, yes, predictable. But I suspect almost nobody who sees “The Peanut Butter Falcon” will mind much. Along with the cinematographer, Nigel Bluck, and the editors, Kevin Tent and Nathaniel Fuller, the directors achieve a relaxed and amiable vibe while moving the story forward with dispatch through picturesque Southern Atlantic land and seascapes.  And Gottsagen is a disarming performer who creates a sweet and funny character. As storytellers, Nilson and Schwartz are careful to cover their bases — an early reference to Eleanor being a woman of independent means helps the film’s finale go down easier, plausibility-wise — but the center of their film is completely without contrivance. The Peanut Butter Falcon Rated PG-13 for pratfalls, shenanigans, language. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes."
130,After the Wedding,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/movies/after-the-wedding-review.html,"A supreme example of classed-up mediocrity, “After the Wedding,” a pointless remake of Susanne Bier’s 2007 melodrama of the same name, offers little that’s new and a lot that’s predictable, even to first-time viewers. What has changed in the intervening years is us: The economic and political environment into which this new version drops might cause us to view its plot through more cynical eyes. To no obvious benefit — and some logical detriment — the genders of the central characters have been flipped. The film’s emotional tone is also cooler and more restrained, as if tainted by the brittle self-interest of its most vivid character, Theresa (Julianne Moore). The owner of a thriving media company, Theresa occupies a luxurious Long Island estate where her dreamy husband, Oscar (Billy Crudup), is planning an exhibition of his sculptures. By contrast, the saintly Isabel (Michelle Williams) spends her days serenely meditating in an Indian slum and tending a teeming orphanage. When Theresa summons her to New York, dangling a possible multimillion-dollar donation to the orphanage, Isabel is peeved to learn she must also attend the wedding of Theresa’s daughter, Grace (a very sweet Abby Quinn). A dowdy duckling among swans, Isabel would much rather take the money and run. Written and directed by Moore’s husband, Bart Freundlich, “After the Wedding” buffs poverty and philanthropy to the same high gloss as Theresa’s furniture. As wedding-reception revelations and plot twists pile up, Freundlich, as if fearing to revel in the soapiness of his setup, repeatedly tamps down the conflict. As a result, what should be a volcano of betrayal and acrimony never fully erupts; even Moore’s brief meltdown feels staged, and Isabel is so irritatingly tranquil that Williams has no room to breathe in the role. In place of satisfying spectacle, then, we get a movie pocked with sappy symbolism and facile foreshadowing — like Moore’s fixation on the abandoned eggs in a dried-up bird’s nest. The original “Wedding” was a more unruly affair; this one is creamy and languid, with Julio Macat’s camera soaring high above foreign trees and kissing glowing, caramel skins. Accompanied by Mychael Danna’s moony score, the movie juxtaposes rich and poor, selfish and selfless, motherhood and its substitute. But its characterizations are hollow and its ethics questionable, the cruel manipulation of Isabel softened and, ultimately, forgiven. More than anything, though, “After the Wedding” is a movie that openly admires the casual ability of the rich to purchase whatever they want. Including the remnants of other people’s dreams. After the Wedding Rated PG-13 for a discordantly vulgar outburst and a tragic event. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes. "
131,Light of My Life,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/movies/light-of-my-life-review.html,"In a bleak future where women have been wiped out by a deadly plague, a forlorn man and his young daughter, disguised as a boy, make their way through the wilderness. You probably haven’t seen this movie before, but then again you sort of have. Written and directed by Casey Affleck, who also stars, “Light of My Life” offers a predictable dystopian premise, recalling everything from “The Road” and “Children of Men” to Debra Granik’s decidedly unfuturistic father-daughter survivalist drama “Leave No Trace.” So it’s not original, but it is enlivened by some artful touches and two excellent performances. Affleck’s familiar melancholy energy is ideal for the part of a man (known only as Dad) who is struggling to persist in a world without hope, if only to ensure his child’s survival. His simmering sadness has a self-sustaining quality — it never explodes or wears itself out. His daughter, Rag (Anna Pniowsky), is the opposite: Though she’s loyal to her father, her headstrong curiosity suggests her spirit won’t be contained for much longer. As these two drift through forbiddingly quiet forests, sparsely populated towns and eerily empty homes, Affleck’s camera takes in the desolate, dead-end majesty of this shattered world. He directs with a delicate touch — but it might be too delicate. At nearly two hours, the film has a staid, even-keeled tone that wears after a while, especially since we learn so little about these characters. We’re immersed in their reality, but not particularly involved in it. Light of My Life Rated R for some violence and utter hopelessness. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes."
132,The Angry Birds Movie 2,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/movies/the-angry-birds-movie-2-review.html,"You can pinpoint the exact moment when “The Angry Birds Movie 2” decides it’s going to stop being one kind of animated sequel and becomes another. The original 2016 film, based on the popular video games, imagined an island full of flightless birds being suddenly terrorized by green porcine, egg-stealing invaders. The new movie starts in a constant state of sniping between Bird Island and Piggy Island, with each group playing elaborate, cruel pranks on one another. Then, a third, even more menacing island emerges — Eagle Island, run by a brilliant but embittered eagle named Zeta (voiced by Leslie Jones), who sends destructive ice-balls toward both pigs and birds. In most cases, a sequel would either expand upon or regurgitate the previous setup, so one might expect yet another foray — this time led by the first film’s hero Red (Jason Sudeikis) and his former nemesis, the pig chieftain Leonard (Bill Hader) — into the new island. And that is exactly what happens. But as soon as the group arrives on Eagle Island, “Angry Birds 2” mostly tosses story, character and sense aside, and opts for a go-for-broke style of humor. The hoops our heroes jump through become increasingly surreal and hilarious. Highlights include a bit involving an attempt to steal an eagle’s ID card at a urinal, and a breakdance battle that comes out of nowhere and is resolved in even stranger fashion. Those hoping for a sharply-scripted, well-proportioned work may be disappointed, but one might ask them why they’re seeing a film called “The Angry Birds Movie 2” in the first place. The Angry Birds Movie 2 Rated PG for mild animated violence and one terrifying scene involving crabs raining from the skies. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes."
133,Blinded by the Light,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/movies/blinded-by-the-light-review.html,"Many musicians refer to themselves as storytellers, but few of them have the tales to back up the claim. Bruce Springsteen does. And his song-stories about desperate dreamers trying to break free of dead-end towns resonate far from what he once called “the swamps of Jersey,” whence his music originated. The new movie “Blinded by the Light” — based, as its opening announces, on a true story — showcases Springsteen’s music as the driving force in the life of a 1980s teenager in the London suburb of Luton. Javed, the son of Pakistani immigrants, is 16 and feeling very stuck in a one-horse town in which the local racists are keen to shut down its one mosque.  An aspiring poet and lyricist, Javed, unlike many of the characters in Springsteen’s songs, isn’t a car nut. He’s not only clueless about all things chrome-wheeled and fuel-injected, but he’s also rarely permitted to drive his family’s bucket of bolts. Yet he is intimate with other Springsteenesque conditions: of being tired and bored with himself, of wanting to change his clothes and hair and face, of asserting that he’s a man and not a boy, and of believing in the promised land. Initially a Pet Shop Boys guy, Javed, played with winning charm and sincerity by Viveik Kalra, has his sensibility recalibrated after a friend lends him two of the Boss’s cassettes during a particularly fraught time with his family. Many of his hassles result from his relationship with his movie-standard-issue immigrant father, Malik (Kulvinder Ghir, dignifying a role that gives him little to work with), who’s been laid off from his assembly-line job at Vauxhall Motors. Directed by Gurinder Chadha, best known for the effortlessly charming “Bend It Like Beckham,” “Blinded by the Light” is simultaneously overdetermined and unfocused, and shows a lot more strain. One of the movie’s screenwriters, Sarfraz Manzoor, is the author of the true story on which the movie is based, the 2007 memoir “Greetings From Bury Park.” But here, liberties beyond the normal ones were taken with the factual narrative. The movie relentlessly barrels to a reconciliation that the actual circumstances of Manzoor’s life story made impossible. Which would be more forgivable, if the movie were not equally relentless in checking dozens of boxes of poignance and treacle. The movie’s heavy-handedness is exemplified by a scene in which Javed abandons his sister on her wedding day to run to an HMV music store to buy Springsteen tickets. Immediately thereafter his family runs right smack into a march by the racist thugs of the National Front. They rough up Malik, who at that point realizes his son isn’t around. Then Javed’s politically-active white girlfriend helps dad clean up a bloody nose. Speaking of the nose, this movie is on it an awful lot. Then there are the scenes in which the movie flirts with being a musical, giving a “Rock ’n’ Roll High School”/Bollywood treatment to Springsteen’s “Thunder Road” and “Born to Run.” These songs have the power to move, inspire, make you dance. For the first time in my experience of Springsteen, they made me want to hide under my seat. Blinded by the Light Rated PG-13. Mister, I ain’t a boy, no, I’m a man. Running time: 1 hour 57 minutes."
134,Good Boys,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/movies/good-boys-review.html,"The kids are all right in “Good Boys.” The adults are something else. If you’re familiar with the crude comedy of misadventure and sentimental education — every generation has its self-defining favorite — you have pretty much seen this movie. The big difference (cue the elevator pitch) is that this time the boys are boys, specifically 12-year-olds whose innocence about sex, drugs, women, themselves, is grist for a feature-length joke. Sometimes the joke is funny and sometimes not, a familiar hit-and-miss ratio for the production team of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, who have established a comedy brand that’s equal parts raunchiness and sentimentality (“This Is the End,” “Sausage Party”). The most obvious model for “Good Boys” is their hit “Superbad,” a sweet ’n’ silly coming-of-age tale about three high school seniors trying to lose their virginity before heading off to college. Written by Rogen and Goldberg, “Superbad” owes much to Judd Apatow, a producer and comedy spirit guide who understands that human frailties tend to make the laughs stick. In “Good Boys” that frailty is existential, a matter of tender age and being. Size matters too, of course, particularly in the case of the lead boy, Max (Jacob Tremblay), who’s dwarfed by nearly everyone else and whose slight build serves as a constant, sometimes uneasy reminder of just how young he is. Along with his best friends, Lucas (Keith L. Williams), and Thor (Brady Noon), Max is in the sixth grade and freaking out over the customary things: older kids, being cool, girls, his body.  Max knows that something is happening to him and while he has a grasp on his metamorphosis, he is completely unprepared to deal with it. This makes Max vulnerable — he is, after all, a child — a state of being the movie exploits. Sometimes this exploitation is lightly amusing and good-natured, as when Max curses or goes gaga over a crush. But while it’s ticklishly humorous when he, Lucas and Thor find a stash of parental sex toys that they guilelessly brandish (Max puts on a black fetish hood, as if it were a Halloween mask), the joke is very clearly on them. By the time the three are trying to cross a busy multilane freeway, frantically dodging cars and shrieking about death, it is no longer funny because, well, it isn’t, mostly because the moviemakers have turned into bullies. Directed by Gene Stupnitsky, who wrote the script with Lee Eisenberg, “Good Boys” is stuffed with minor and major incidents and exchanges that take place mostly during a single day. Some are harmless; one is criminal. There are drugs, a sex doll, a stranger (Stephen Merchant) and other useless adults. There’s also two young women (Molly Gordon and Midori Francis) who draw the boys into an escalating misadventure involving Ecstasy and some well-staged slapstick. The women are cartoonish stereotypes — sexy, unpredictable, threatening, mysterious, sweet. Mostly they’re previews for what the boys can look forward to when they’re in nastier teen flicks. A lot of comedy is predicated on the pain of others and laughing at silly and stupid people doing and saying foolish, sometimes dangerous things. You become an accomplice when you laugh at the buffoon slipping on the banana peel, the dim bulb licking icy metal, the jackass leaping into a whirling ceiling fan. Part of the pleasure of the spectacle of idiocy can be its purity, and the rush of simple, liberating anarchic laughter. It can be exciting when the jokes are a challenge, make you squirm, offend you, confront your norms and mores. Are you laughing at the characters or along with them, and what does it matter anyway if the jokes are funny? In “Good Boys,” the comedy turns on the adventurous mishaps, the fears and tears of 12-year-olds, which — because these are children, played by real children — means it is predicated on your ethical indifference. It banks on your cruelty, which might be interesting if the movie acknowledged its meanness and didn’t smother it in the requisite late-act sentimental blather about friendship, family and so on. Instead, it asks us to laugh and keep unthinkingly laughing, even as its three very appealing child leads who, by virtue of their transparent vulnerability and the unvarnished sincerity of their performances, show you the movie that might have been. Good Boys Rated R for profanity and child endangerment. Running time: 1 hour 29 minutes."
136,47 Meters Down: Uncaged,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/movies/47-meters-down-uncaged-review.html,"Saved from straight-to-DVD purgatory at the last minute and given a theatrical release, the 2017 sleeper hit “47 Meters Down” was an elegantly directed, well-acted, and surprisingly compelling thriller about two sisters stuck in a cage being terrorized by sharks. Its sequel, “47 Meters Down: Uncaged,” with its silly scenario, irritating characters, and garbled action, plays like a rebuke of the earlier film. This time, it’s another set of sisters (played by Corinne Foxx and Sophie Nelisse) reluctantly joining two other girls from school (Brianne Tju and Sistine Stallone) for an impromptu cave dive in a secret cove in the Yucatán. They don state-of-the-art scuba gear and plunge in, only to get trapped in a long-buried city of the dead, where they come across a type of shark that has evolved in the darkness without eyesight but with other, highly attuned senses. The director, Johannes Roberts, also helmed the earlier film, and while he created a palpable sense of claustrophobia in that effort — even in scenes set in the open sea — here he flounders in his attempts to build dread in tight spaces. The bickering girls are often stuck in underwater caves and corridors, but the action is unclear and the menace unconvincing. The tin-eared dialogue — of which there is a shocking amount, for a movie set largely underwater — doesn’t help either. It’s hard to care for characters when what they do and say rings so false. The result plays like the kind of sleazy exploitation movie that the first one so studiously avoided becoming. 47 Meters Down: Uncaged Rated PG-13 for some grisly shark attacks and poor teenage decision-making. Running time: 1 hour 29 minutes."
138,Ready or Not,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/movies/ready-or-not-review.html,"In horror movies, it’s hard to go wrong if you’re carving up rich people. Unless you’re screening in a white-collar prison, the audience is likely to be immediately on board — especially if the blade is wielded by a disadvantaged Joe or Jane. That’s certainly the case with Grace (a fantastic Samara Weaving) in “Ready or Not,” a blood-drenched, joke-sprinkled harpooning of soul-sucking greed and inbred family values. A former foster child, Grace is eager to marry her ultrawealthy husband, Alex (Mark O’Brien), but not for his money: she’s so keen to have a real family that even his dauntingly odd extended brood will suffice. Until now, Alex has resisted. An heir to a board-game dynasty (“We prefer ‘dominion,’” he tells her), he’s been virtually estranged from his off-putting relatives. As a brief prologue suggests, he had very good reason. So when a post-nuptials family meeting is called to inform Grace that tradition requires her to play an initiation game of Hide-and-Seek, he’s visibly nervous. Off she scuttles in her wedding dress to cram herself into a dumbwaiter, blithely unaware that, somewhere below in this sprawling, Addams-family mansion, her in-laws are arming themselves to the teeth with old-timey weapons. If she survives until dawn, they believe their fortune will disappear; as they’ll find out, the reality is infinitely more messy. Directed, with more efficiency than novelty, by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (two-thirds of the collective known as Radio Silence), “Ready or Not” turns the home-invasion thriller inside out. Relentless and thoroughly preposterous, Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy’s script hews to its own batty logic, its frantic pacing peppered with morbid humor. Alex’s coke-fueled sister keeps accidentally killing the help, and a wicked Andie MacDowell, as Grace’s implacably murderous mother-in-law, is clearly having a blast with that ancient bow and arrow. But it’s Weaving who gives this blunt satire of class warfare a heart. Surrounded by cartoon villains, she’s easy to applaud: There’s no side to Grace, just a fearless decency and school-of-hard-knocks scrappiness that’s never diluted with a nudge or a wink. Her performance — like the tormented way that Adam Brody, playing Alex’s vaguely dissipated brother, delivers his too-few lines — reminds us that extreme wealth is often paid for by the suffering of others. Her deconstructed wedding dress, on the other hand, simply screams that women should think twice before asking for that ring. Ready or Not Rated R for ubiquitous splatter and satanic invocations. Running time: 1 hour and 35 minutes."
139,Angel Has Fallen,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/movies/angel-has-fallen-review.html,"You might think that by now, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) has risked enough to be beyond suspicion. In “Olympus Has Fallen,” the indomitable Secret Service agent took down an army of terrorists holding the president hostage in the White House. In “London Has Fallen,” he escorted the commander in chief through the British capital during an attack that killed several world leaders. But you’re only as good as your last rescue, and the one that jump-starts “Angel Has Fallen” — lethal drones target the president (Morgan Freeman) during a fishing excursion, slaughtering his security detail except for Mike — raises eyebrows. The F.B.I. thinks Mike masterminded the assassination attempt. Mike must shoot and drive his way through choppily edited action sequences to prove his innocence. “The Fugitive,” to which “Angel” owes perhaps even its rooftop finale, is a template against which this movie inevitably falls short. But Jada Pinkett Smith, as an agent who hand-waves the need for subpoenas, has the equivalent of the Tommy Lee Jones role. “Angel Has Fallen” appears to have aimed higher than its predecessors, both of which started in forehead-slapping territory and grew dumber with every twist. The Ric Roman Waugh-directed “Angel,” by contrast, is capital-T topical. It’s filled with references to painkiller dependency, Russian election tampering, private defense contractors and citizen militias, even as it avoids adhering to any viewpoint that might alienate potential audiences. Nick Nolte turns up as Mike’s estranged father, a grizzled Vietnam veteran and hermit who growls all the paternal advice he was never around to give, at least when he’s not comically detonating explosive booby traps. In this context, his scenery-chewing qualifies as subtle. Angel Has Fallen Rated R. One onslaught after another. Running time: 2 hours."
140,Brittany Runs a Marathon,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/movies/brittany-runs-a-marathon-review.html,"The supposedly feel-good comedy “Brittany Runs a Marathon” aims for more of a runner’s high than joyful indulgence. You may feel miserable while watching it, but the goal is to feel stronger when it’s over. When her story takes off, Brittany (Jillian Bell) is joking her way through a rut. She rushes for a train she always misses and goofs off during a disciplinary meeting at her job. She attends a doctor’s visit hoping to get a prescription for Adderall, but her appointment veers off course when she is instead told her lifestyle is putting her health at risk. Her heart rate and blood pressure are high, and so her doctor recommends that she lose around 50 pounds. For Brittany, who sleeps until noon and drinks all night with her judgmental roommate Gretchen (Alice Lee, in a thankless role), the diagnosis is unthinkable; it would require Brittany to change her entire life. But she does, one agonizing step at a time. Brittany starts running to avoid having to pay for a gym membership. As she builds her endurance, she meets new friends, Seth (Micah Stock) and Catherine (Michaela Watkins), who encourage her attempts to grow. With them, Brittany trains to run the New York City Marathon. But for every sign of success, Brittany is plagued with self-doubt; for every offering of kindness, she is overcome with suspicion. The writer and director Paul Downs Colaizzo follows Brittany’s training, focusing less on the challenge of running than on the psychological barriers that impede physical achievement. As Brittany nears her goals, she lashes out more and more against those who seem to affirm her self-worth. She alienates Seth and Catherine when they offer financial support, and outright rejects the dopey affections of Jern (Utkarsh Ambudkar), a sweetly rootless millennial who hits it off with Brittany in the middle of her transformation. Brittany’s kneejerk self-deprecation often feels punishing not only to the character but also to the audience. Bell imbues Brittany with humanity and wit, but all too frequently she is working within the framework of a story that seems hellbent on robbing her character of joy. Likewise, the bouncy mood set by the movie’s bright colors and zippy one-liners is cut down to size by the less humorous cruelty thrown Brittany’s way — and by the cruelty she shows to herself and others. And while there are references to bodies being beautiful at all sizes, there’s no suggestion that her mental health might benefit from the same attention given to her physical health. Perhaps running can’t treat both at the same time. The best thing that can be said for “Brittany Runs a Marathon” is that it does make long distance running seem achievable. After all, if Brittany endures such unrelenting emotional anguish on her way to the starting line, how bad can the physical pain of a marathon be? Brittany Runs a Marathon Rated R for sex, drugs and worn-down soles. Running time: 1 hour and 43 minutes."
143,Burn,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/movies/the-body-remembers-when-the-world-broke-open-review.html,"There’s a crucial scene near the midpoint of the Canadian drama “The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open,” and it brilliantly illuminates the experiential chasm between its two leads. It takes place in a taxicab where Aila (Elle-Maija Tailfeathers, who also wrote and directed the film with Kathleen Hepburn) is accompanying Rosie (Violet Nelson), a woman she has only recently met, to a safe house. Both women are indigenous; but where Aila is willowy and elegantly dressed, Rosie is stocky and awkward, her pregnant body wrapped in mismatched clothing and her hair clotted over the bruises left by her boyfriend’s knuckles. Out of nowhere, Rosie spins an elaborate fantasy for their driver, telling him that Aila is her sister and they are taking her to rehab. What she’s doing is flipping the script, the one playing in the driver’s head about which of his passengers is likely to be in need of help. It tells us that Rosie is painfully aware of how she looks and what people are thinking about her. And how much it hurts. Filmed almost entirely in real time, and using a series of long, intimate takes, “The Body Remembers” is about privilege and its lack, motherhood and its absence, race and its legacy. Following the women as closely as a besotted lover, Norm Li’s hand-held camera rarely turns its gaze elsewhere. So when a grizzling baby is brought onto a bus where Rosie is sitting, we see only her softening reaction to it. And when Aila lies on a gynecologist’s table while he installs a contraceptive device, her expression of anxiety and discomfort becomes the story of the scene. Afterward, when she finds Rosie barefoot and bleeding in the rain, the infuriated yells of an unseen attacker fuel the panic of their escape. By blocking our peripheral vision, Tailfeathers and Hepburn punch up the urgency of their narrative. Natural sounds — like the blast of city clamor that greets Aila upon leaving the doctor’s office — become stand-ins for visual information, while Rosie’s unexpected gusts of foul language signal the bitterness of long-endured humiliations. Yet as she listens to Joni Mitchell’s sad-sweet ballad, “Little Green” (about the daughter Mitchell gave up for adoption), we see not distress, but determination. By the end, we might be asking ourselves who is really helping whom. The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 45 minutes."
144,Official Secrets,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/movies/official-secrets-review.html,"It takes real directing talent to make offices look exciting, what with all those computer screens and carceral cubicles. In “The Post,” the 2017 nail-biter about The Washington Post’s decision to publish the Pentagon Papers, Steven Spielberg turned offices into war zones, and Xeroxing into a heart-thumping race to save democracy. The whistle-blower in “Official Secrets”  has only one memo to print out, a modest if mighty task that here looks like, well, a woman anxiously using an office printer in bad lighting. One of those ripped-from-the-headlines jobs, “Official Secrets” revisits how a British intelligence officer, Katharine Gun (Keira Knightley), tried to stop a war. In 2003, a few months before the invasion of Iraq, Gun received an email that had been sent to her division in Britain’s Government Communications Headquarters (a.k.a. GCHQ). It was from Frank Koza, identified as the chief of staff for the regional targets division at the National Security Agency of the United States. The agency was “mounting a surge,” he wrote, for “the whole gamut of information that could give US policymakers an edge in obtaining results favorable to US goals or to head off surprises.” Specifically, the N.S.A. was asking its British colleagues at GCHQ for information on United Nations delegates whose votes on the Security Council were critical in the resolution authorizing the war. Outraged by the N.S.A.’s memo, Gun leaked the Koza email — hence the printer scene — which was published by The Observer, whose editors and reporters are portrayed as a bickering, absurd bunch. Despite this, the movie’s faith in journalism is touching, conveyed by the likable actors playing its cynical-yet-noble rogues: the forcefully restrained Matthew Goode, a clownishly bellowing Rhys Ifans, a sly Conleth Hill as an ethically challenged editor. This is somewhat familiar story terrain for Knightley, who played a code breaker in “The Imitation Game,” about the race to decipher Nazi intelligence during World War II. The job in “Official Secrets” is considerably less exciting. Each workday, Katharine settles into her cubicle in a sepulchral GCHQ office where she translates Mandarin Chinese and cheerfully stops a pal from nibbling her breakfast. She’s pleasant, lives in a nice flat and has a cute, cuddly husband (Adam Bakri). As spies go, the character is pretty much a snore, which may be why Knightley comes across at first as overly emphatic, as if she were trying to fill in a sketch with smiles and her own magnetism. The director Gavin Hood, who wrote the script with Sara Bernstein and Gregory Bernstein, fits the pieces together coherently, no small thing given the complications. But the characters are malnourished and Hood’s attempts to build suspense often fall flat because he leans hard on genre conventions, on dark shadows, ominous music and abrupt sounds straight from a horror flick. When Katharine finally shares the top-secret document, he uses shallow depth of field to express her isolation. She’s freaked, as jittery as a cornered cat, but her fear is largely expressed through her surroundings — the inky night, a passing jogger — instead of her complex, agitated interiority. Knightley has more to do as the plot thickens — there’s a race to the rescue and bureaucratic villainy — and she and the rest of the cast remain the draw in “Official Secrets.” It’s too bad, then, that Matt Smith, as the reporter who breaks the story, isn’t given enough to create a plausible, rounded character. Smith has a talent for playing men who seem both to be trying to get away with something and worried about getting caught, but who nevertheless blunder forward. His Martin is skittish and a bit sleazy, which makes him stick in his scenes, but he slides out of your head once Katharine’s lawyers, and particularly Ralph Fiennes as Ben Emmerson, ride to the rescue. With his self-possessed charisma and a watchfulness that suggests there are depths to fathom, Fiennes pulls you toward him whatever he’s saying or doing, elevating both “Official Secrets” and the other actors, though at a cost to Katharine. If she personifies individual conscience — she is livid that her government would lie to its people — Ben, the movie suggests, has a deeper, nobler claim on the truth. That effectively helps shift the narrative’s center of gravity from Katharine to Ben, an inequity that the final scene underlines. Katherine has courage, personal problems and righteous indignation, but it is Ben who represents the audience-friendly idea that right must triumph over might. Official Secrets Rated R for menacing dark doings. Running time: 1 hour 51 minutes."
147,The Fanatic,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/movies/the-fanatic-review.html,"Whatever one thinks of Limp Bizkit, the Fred Durst-fronted band has undoubtedly counted some aggressive knuckleheads in its fan base. Similarly, a lot of fellows identify so steadfastly with the movie characters Tony Manero and Danny Zuko that John Travolta, the actor who played them, has felt their devotion in uncomfortable ways. For as much resentment as these celebrities may want to vent about their pushier fans, there’s still no excuse for the hatefulness of “The Fanatic,” which Durst directs and Travolta stars in. Hauling considerable paunch and sporting the worst looking hair of his entire career, Travolta plays Moose, a genre-movie enthusiast and autograph hound. The abrupt and awkward Moose appears to be on the autism spectrum. The only characters who seem aware of his condition are the lowlifes of Hollywood Boulevard who bully him. Everyone else interacts with him as if he’s just rude. A man-child with a good deal of self-pity and almost zero empathy, Moose is particularly fixated on the action-movie star Hunter Dunbar (Devon Sawa). After failing to get his movie collection signed at a store appearance, Moose starts encroaching on Hunter’s personal space in ever more aggressive ways. This territory was more profitably explored by Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy.” For that matter, it was more profitably explored in the miles-more-trashy Tony Scott movie “The Fan.” Durst has a good eye for L.A.’s seamy underbelly. But he’s also annoyingly disingenuous, as when he signals Dunbar’s regular-guy quality by having him play a Bizkit tune for his kid while out for a drive. As it lumbers to its climax, the movie delineates the border that separates the merely stale from the genuinely rancid. For all the heavy lifting “The Fanatic” does, it winds up on the weaker side of the divide. The Fanatic Rated R for violence, language, staleness. Running time: 1 hour 29 minutes."
148,It Chapter Two,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/movies/it-chapter-two-review.html,"The chatter from the Venice Film Festival last weekend was all about “The Joker.” Masterpiece or menace? You can decide for yourself after Oct. 4, when that movie opens, but if you need some killer-clown action in the meantime, you’re welcome to “It Chapter Two.” Two years after the first “It” — and 27 years after the events depicted therein — the seven youngsters who faced down evil in the nightmare-ridden, postcard-pretty town of Derry, Me., reunite for another battle. Like a diabolical cicada, Pennywise the Clown — or rather the supernatural force whose principal avatar he is — has emerged from a period of dormancy, bringing his wheedling, lethal psychological manipulation to a new generation of victims. The first horror we witness in “Chapter Two” — a murderous homophobic attack during a carnival — is something Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) exploits rather than perpetrates, and it serves as a reminder that the otherworldly cruelty he represents is not the only kind. Pennywise, who sometimes takes the form of a giant spider-like monster, and whose pouty moue can suddenly sprout rows of sharp, brownish fangs, both feeds and feeds upon ordinary human viciousness. That connection between the banal and the cosmic — the two-way metaphorical street that makes Derry a kind of World Heritage Site for terror — is central to the imagination of Stephen King, whose book is the source of both chapters of “It” (and the earlier made-for-television version). The director, Andy Muschietti, and the screenwriter, Gary Dauberman, have taken some narrative liberties, but they remain true to some of King’s major ideas: about how innocence can be corrupted and preserved by knowledge; about the hidden pathways between the unconscious and the natural world; about the ethical power of friendship. King’s brief on-screen appearance (playing the curmudgeonly proprietor of an antique store) can be taken as a seal of approval. Muschietti is also faithful to King’s conviction that when it comes to plot, incident and audience time commitment, more is more. But page counts and running times work in different ways. An 1,100-page novel like “It” can be a breathless page-turner. But this 2-hour-49-minute movie drags more than it jumps, wearing out its premise and possibly also your patience as it lumbers toward the final showdown. Along the way there is some fun — some scares, some warm feelings, some inventive ickiness — to be found. One of the strengths of the first “It” was its young cast, the members of which return here in flashbacks, preserved on the brink of puberty by sometimes unnerving digital effects. Their pushing-40 selves, whose Losers’ Club reunion occupies most of the story, are played by Jessica Chastain, Bill Hader, James McAvoy, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone and Andy Bean. That’s a pretty crowded car pool, though one of them opts out before the big reunion. Everyone has left Derry with the exception of Mike (Mustafa), who has spent decades in an upper room of the public library, researching local history and Native American religion in the hopes of finding out what happened to him and his friends back in 1989. The others have tried to forget all about it, and have managed to put some distance between themselves and their accursed hometown. Bill (McAvoy) is a big-shot Hollywood screenwriter; Ben (Ryan) is an architect; Richie (Hader) is an edgy comedian; Eddie (Ransone) is a risk analyst. Beverley (Chastain), the only girl in the club, has a less well-defined professional profile, as does Stanley (Bean), who lives in a big apartment in New York. The main thing we learn about Bev is that she has an abusive husband. That fact signals the continuity between her child and adult selves. Young Bev (Sophia Lillis) had a monstrous dad, and most of her pals had family troubles of their own. Even without the flashbacks, the movie effectively explores the ways, sometimes uncanny and sometimes charming, that people don’t change. (It’s less effective in evoking Derry, which feels like a brightly-colored generic stage set rather than the woods-weird Gothic hamlet of King’s imagination). The young and grown-up actors shadow one another nicely. Hader and Finn Wolfhard, who plays the antsy, motor-mouthed, 13-year-old Richie, are an especially inspired pairing. The child is father to the man. Mike thinks he has figured out a strategy for stopping It (a.k.a. Pennywise), and without going too far into the metaphysics of the thing (or into spoiler territory), I can tell you that it requires each Loser to go off alone to delve into his or her own private guilt, shame, fear and desire. This is a mixed blessing. The individual excursions give Muschietti opportunities to spin out some ingeniously creepy set pieces — though none quite matches an early sequence involving demonic fortune cookies — but they also stall the movie in a mire of repetition. We don’t learn much about the characters or their adversary that we didn’t know already. We also know how the whole thing will end — not so much in terms of plot details (though we kind of know that, too) as of spectacle. The big fight at the end of “Chapter Two” is a lot like the one at the end of Chapter One, which is a lot like every other climactic, big-budget action-movie battle. It’s not scary or surprising to watch a movie’s heart and imagination being devoured by the same old thing, but it is dispiriting. It Chapter Two Rated R. Very bad clown. Very bad language. Running time: 2 hours 49 minutes."
149,Satanic Panic,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/movies/satanic-panic-review.html,"The comedy-horror film “Satanic Panic” is the kind of movie that revels in the details of eviscerations and demonic orgies. With jovial bad taste and a bag of gruesome tricks, the director Chelsea Stardust cheerfully invites her audience to hail Satan. The movie follows young Sam (Hayley Griffith), a pizza delivery woman, who starts the day beleaguered and ends up bedeviled. After being stiffed for her tip at a mansion, Sam enters the house to find a satanic cult on the very night it plans to implant a demon spawn in the womb of a virgin. Unfortunately for Sam, the bloodthirsty tribe zeros in on her apple-cheeked purity, choosing her as the vessel for their infernal ritual. She is captured by the cult’s maven, Danica (Rebecca Romijn), but soon escapes, proving herself a worthy opponent for demon worshipers. In increasingly bloody fashion, the cult unleashes the power of hell and Earth to pull Sam back. “Satanic Panic” is a familiar story, cooked up from old-horror standbys — the plucky virgin, the devilish matron — but its throwback “final girl” narrative avoids being merely regressive. The movie stands out from contemporary horror for its lack of pretension and its simple commitment to inventing ways for pretty people to get slaughtered. Characters are disemboweled, heroines vomit bugs — the film thrills with gore and grotesquerie. Forgoing the all-too-familiar slickness of computer-generated imagery, Stardust instead showcases old-school practical effects, bringing imaginative glee to her colorful conjuring with every line and image. In her hands, Sam’s bad night provides goofy, goopy fun. Satanic Panic Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes."
151,The Goldfinch,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/movies/the-goldfinch-review.html,"Imagine you’re at a party — a fancy, catered thing with hors d’oeuvres floating by on trays and golden light suffusing a vast, elegant room. You run into someone you sort of know, maybe someone from college or an old job or who used to date a former roommate. Hey! What’s up? Clutching what must be the evening’s third or fourth glass of Champagne, this person excitedly tells you about staying up all night to finish “The Goldfinch,” by Donna Tartt, which is the most amazing book. Have you read it? No? So, see, the bird is actually a painting of a bird, and there’s this kid named Theo. … Hours pass. Other people you recognize drift toward the conversation then, wisely, retreat from it. The light grows dim. The bar shimmers like a mirage on the horizon. Well-mannered soul that you are, you have nodded and smiled and tried to pay attention through various tangents and emendations as your friend leads you through a thousand pages worth of plot. (Oh but before he went to Amsterdam with the guy he knew from Nevada. …) transcript My name is John Crowley, and I’m the director of “The Goldfinch.” So in the scene, we have young Theo who is played by Oakes Fegley, who is in Hobie, who is played by Jeffrey Wright, in Hobie’s basement workshop, which is a place that restores antiques. Here, at this moment, he is literally passing on in a tactile fashion— how to recognize what is real or authentic piece of period furniture, as opposed to a reproduction one. “If it’s too even, like, here. then it’s reproduction.” It’s the kid learning in action and being surprised and slightly delighted that his hands actually feel what Hobie’s pointing out to him. Jeffrey Wright brought such a gorgeously tactile quality to this scene, which I think he spotted in the expert who came in to talk to him about the antiques. So this idea of touching the antiques. And using his spittle to bring up the grain on the mahogany is very much what he learned hands-on himself. “So this one is fake.” “Well, no, it’s only fake if you try to pass it off as an original.” The idea of the doubles is very important in the scene. That’s why we set up that shot between those two chairs and end with the pair of them framed between them. And moving from there around to the side was all about which is the key piece of information that’s moving forward. So you come around on Hobie when he is actually beginning to handle the furniture and touch it. “That glow— that’s hundreds of years being touched, used.” We also have added in a piece of music, which is embedded into the background there— a piece by a Zydeco accordion player called Boozoo Chavis which has a sort of warmth to it and is not like the musical identity of any other part of the film. [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] To be honest, it sounds kind of interesting. There are fake antiques (not like totally fake, but not strictly authentic either), drugs and drug dealers, terrorism and romance. (Because see the other girl, the one he’s engaged to, is the sister of the kid he lived with after his mother got killed in the bombing, and then her mother. …) Finally you are released into the night air, drained and bewildered, wondering what that was all about. The above represents my attempt to convey to you, without taking up too much of your time — because we barely know each other and I see your eyes darting over to the review of the Jennifer Lopez stripper movie — what it’s like to watch “The Goldfinch,” John Crowley’s earnest and utterly flummoxing adaptation of Tartt’s 2013 book. I should say that I admire the novel, a best seller and a Pulitzer Prize winner, though not as much as I like Tartt’s others, “The Secret History” and “The Little Friend.” And it’s clear that Crowley (director of the lovely “Brooklyn”) and the film’s screenwriter, Peter Straughan (of the risible “Snowman”), also admire it. They just can’t, given two and a half hours of the viewer’s time, quite manage to explain why. Theo, a New Yorker whose mother is killed by a bomb at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who goes to live with a patrician family on the Upper East Side and then with his no-account father in the Nevada desert, who befriends a furniture restorer and a Russian latchkey kid, who takes a lot of drugs and treasures the tiny 17th-century Dutch painting he snatched from the rubble at the Met, who attempts suicide in Amsterdam and occasionally resorts to voice-over, is played as a boy by Oakes Fegley and in early manhood by Ansel Elgort. The younger version is said to look like Harry Potter — his Russian pal, Boris (Finn Wolfhard, then Aneurin Barnard), calls him Potter — but he put me more in mind of a miniature George Will. Grown-up Theo’s face is remarkably smooth. Does he never shave, I found myself wondering, or does he shave all the time? There is much more to wonder about, beyond the basic what-why-and-how of the story. In many ways, “The Goldfinch” approximates what we normally think of as a movie. There are actors — some good ones, too, well known and less so. Nicole Kidman. Sarah Paulson. Jeffrey Wright. Denis O’Hare. Willa Fitzgerald. Ryan Foust. There is music. There is furniture. There are themes and feelings, like loss and grief and the love of beauty and the pleasures of taking drugs, smoking cigarettes and looking attractive. All at once and in succession. But like those dodgy antiques — “changelings,” as their maker supposedly calls them — this film is inauthentic without being completely fake. It looks and sounds like a movie without quite being one. It’s more like a Pinterest page or a piece of fan art, the record of an enthusiasm that is, to the outside observer, indistinguishable from confusion. The Goldfinch Rated R. It takes a lot of drugs to get through this. Running time: 2 hours 29 minutes."
152,Hustlers,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/movies/hustlers-review.html,"“Hustlers,” a semisweet, half-flat cocktail of exposed flesh, fuzzy feminism and high-spirited criminality, overflows with of-the-moment pop-cultural signifiers — Cardi B makes an appearance, and Lizzo does, too — but it also strikes a note of nostalgia for the recent past. Specifically the movie, written and directed by Lorene Scafaria (“The Meddler,” “Seeking a Friend for the End of the World”), looks back fondly at 2007. Back then, before the financial crisis interrupted the fun, Wall Street guys were making a lot of money, a decent amount of which found its way into the hands and under the G-strings of New York strippers. As the movie tells it, the high point of this era — remembered as “the last great night” by one of the participants — arrives when the R&B idol Usher (playing himself) rolls into the club where the main characters work, sending dollar bills raining down on the delighted dancers. The scene is a slow-motion bacchanal, a tableau of pure glamour and delight, a snapshot of carnal-capitalist utopia. It softens some of the struggle and sleaze that we’ve already witnessed, and justifies the entrepreneurial larceny to come. Our guide through the highs and lows of this world is Destiny (Constance Wu), who is telling the story of her career to a journalist. (“Hustlers” is based on a New York Magazine article by Jessica Pressler, whose fictionalized counterpart, called Elizabeth, is played by Julia Stiles.) Raised by her grandmother in Queens, Destiny finds her way to a cavernous Manhattan skin palace with multiple stages, throbbing music and an endless supply of thirsty guys in suits. The job isn’t much fun until she meets Ramona (Jennifer Lopez), a larger-than-life figure who takes Destiny under her wing. More literally, Ramona envelops Destiny in her luxuriant fur coat, a gesture that is maternal and sexual, campy and collegial all at once — an indication of Ramona’s complicated charisma. Ramona is warm, vain, ruthless and unpredictable, and Lopez gathers her contradictions into an incandescent one-woman spectacle. Lopez, a pop-culture legend in her own right, doesn’t so much peel away the layers of her stardom as repurpose them, channeling her exuberant physicality and her quick-witted self-assurance into a performance that is finely calibrated in its realism and brazen in its theatrics. You need made-up adjectives to convey the fusion of craft, nerve and energy that she pulls off: She’s Denzelian, Pacinoesque, downright Anna-Magnanimous. “Hustlers” itself, unfortunately, doesn’t match the scale or audacity of what she does. Ramona is a big, bold, volatile personality inhabiting a story that is small, tentative and risk-averse. A few years after the crash, after an unhappy relationship has left Destiny raising a child on her own, she reunites with Ramona, who also has a daughter and who has found a new way to make money. Instead of working the pole and the V.I.P. rooms, she and Destiny — along with their colleagues, Mercedes (Keke Palmer) and Annabelle (Lili Reinhart) — scour the city’s bars for men of means who can be lured back to the strip club and parted from their credit cards. Eventually the game shifts from a con to something more felonious, as the women, rather than plying their marks with drinks and winks, slip knockout drugs into their cocktails and empty their wallets and expense accounts. It’s not exactly a victimless crime, but “Hustlers” brushes off any serious ethical qualms, partly by making the men, for the most part, interchangeable jerks in an indefensible line of work. Which would be fine if the movie had the courage of its populist convictions. But class struggle isn’t really at stake any more than gender equality is. The spirit of “Hustlers” is so insistently affirmative and celebratory that all kinds of interesting matters are left unexplored. Scafaria makes it clear that she is on Destiny and Ramona’s side. They are loyal friends, devoted mothers, comfortable with their bodies and their choices. All of which is welcome, given the long tradition of treating strippers as easy objects of titillation and moral hand-wringing. But the movie seems to view any examination of its characters’ motives, their working conditions or the consequences of their actions as a kind of betrayal. There are feints in the direction of realism and social inquiry, but every time she might dig a little deeper into Destiny’s inner life or Ramona’s relationships, Scafaria falls back into bubbly girl-boss montages and luxury-brand consumer fetishism. The problem isn’t a refusal of judgment, but rather an absence of perspective, a have-it-all-ways approach to the material that feels evasive. Late in the game — when the game is pretty much up — Ramona asserts that “this whole city, this whole country, is one big strip club,” a metaphor that would be more provocative if the movie had backed it up, had showed any real curiosity about the moral, economic and erotic transactions that keep the hustle running. But maybe that’s the lesson: The money keeps flowing, and nobody’s ever really satisfied. Hustlers Rated R. A lot of what a lot of men would pay a lot to see. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes."
153,The Sound of Silence,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/movies/the-sound-of-silence-review.html,"There’s something about a movie that goes out of its way to embrace the quiet — to make the audience really listen and be fully aware of every snippet of sound or sliver of silence — that feels refreshingly rare. In a medium that can be so reliant on character banter and song-stuffed sound cues, it can be powerful to be forced to concentrate on hearing noiselessness, so that the little sound that does occur is that much more meaningful. “The Sound of Silence,” the feature debut of the director Michael Tyburski (who also wrote the screenplay with Ben Nabors), attempts to wield this power but does more telling than showing. Peter Sarsgaard plays Peter Lucien, a professional house tuner in New York City who assesses the ambient noise in people’s homes (electrical appliances, wind patterns) to pinpoint the source of their anxiety, depression or fatigue. Peter, a quiet observer deliberate in his choice of words, is painstaking in his efforts: The job is his life, and when he’s not acting as an apartment-whisperer, he’s out and about all over the city with tuning forks, mapping out the sonic patterns of each block and neighborhood. Peter’s near-fanatical devotion to his work has served him well as the movie begins: His many satisfied clients leave him voice mail messages of effusive praise for changing their lives; he’s been profiled in The New Yorker. But he becomes unsettled when his diagnosis and proposed solution for Ellen (Rashida Jones), a nonprofit worker, fails to solve her chronic sleep issues. As he tries to get to the root of her problems (including the lingering pain from the demise of a long-term relationship), they develop something like a friendship, or an amiable case of opposites-must-interact. The movie swells with grand ideas about our relationships with sound and with one another, often put forth through Peter’s soft-spoken voice, which oscillates between calming and eerie, or through the quiet and hum of city noises and orchestral music. But there isn’t much there there — the film’s sonic experimentation is decoration hung on a thin character. As stirring as Sarsgaard is in conveying Peter’s eccentricities, he can’t quite transcend the well-worn narrative trope of the obsessive oddball (usually a white man) who is unable to connect deeply with others. Tyburski and Nabors do question their enigmatic protagonist somewhat: Though Peter’s research attracts the interest of a tech company hoping to capitalize on his findings, it’s met with skepticism from the academics and scholars he wants to please most. The suggestion that Peter, like the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, might not be as groundbreaking as he thinks is the most compelling and least proverbial conflict raised in the movie — yet the screenplay skims over it to focus on the conventional dynamic between the often irascible Peter and the more optimistic Ellen, who challenges him on his rigid view of the world. “The Sound of Silence” wants to be heard, but, in the end, doesn’t have much to say.  The Sound of Silence Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 25 minutes."
154,Monos,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/movies/monos-review.html,"High on a mountaintop in Colombia, a raggedy pack of teenagers who answer to names including “Rambo,” “Smurf,” “Wolf,” “Dog” and “Bigfoot” receive supervision, intermittently, from a little person on horseback. These boys and girls have guns, an adult hostage from the United States and, soon, a cow. Their overseer tells them to look after the cow with care, as it is a source of milk. Consequences will rebound if harm comes to the cow. And what do you know. The excitable, sometimes hormonally charged kids let things get a little out of hand one night and, oops, they kill the cow. Which they then rip apart for meat. The ripping apart is depicted in great, bloody, muscle-tearing detail. Thank you, God, for the gift of cinema. “Monos,” directed by Alejandro Landes, is one of those allegories that is cagey about exactly what it is allegorizing. (The title can yield multiple meanings in translation, including “monkeys.”) Child soldiering is an unfortunate fact throughout much of the world, but this paramilitary gang has traits that suggest an extrarealistic interest or intent. Landes shows his hand when one of the band reveals an ambition to “dance on television.” The droopy dopes of Godard’s “Les Carabiniers” here come up flush against the snide, poker-faced contempt of Yorgos Lanthimos. The kids come down from the mountain and into a jungle, dragging their hostage with them. She’s played by Julianne Nicholson, an American, in a performance that suggests the actress endured a fair amount of authentic physical punishment. The teenagers, who change from muddy street clothes to sundry underwear combos as the story line gets more of a “Lord of the Flies” vibe, often have the air of adolescents tearing through a particularly exotic school vacation. Each time their hostage escapes, some give chase while others engage in interpersonal recriminations. They can’t be said to lose sight of the cause they’re fighting for, because they barely knew it to begin with. “Monos” has a high-toned virtuosic quality. The images are often ravishing, what you’d expect from Tarkovsky in a tropical climate. The score, by Mica Levi, is precision-engineered postmodern discomfort. Near the movie’s end, as the group slashes through the jungle to find a member who’s gone AWOL, there’s a shot of some of the armed teens standing between the corpses of the adults they’ve just slain and their living, terrified children. It is meant, perhaps, as some sort of epiphanic provocation, but it registers as nose-thumbing on the director’s part. It’s frustrating to see such a sophisticated cinematic apparatus used in the service of such muddled half-ideas. Monos Rated R. In English and Spanish, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes."
155,Tall Girl,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/movies/tall-girl-review.html,"While the 16-year-old Jodi is smart, kind and pretty and comes from a loving, well-off family, she is endlessly mocked by her classmates and miserable for it. The reason, in case the title “Tall Girl” left any room for ambiguity, is that Jodi is 6-foot-1. Apparently, Ruby Bridges High School does not have a basketball team, and nobody there has ever seen a teenage girl with a growth spurt. It is undeniably tough to be ostracized, especially because kids zero in on difference with unerring meanness. But Jodi’s fate ranks relatively low on the hardship meter. Our heroine, portrayed by the appealingly earnest newcomer Ava Michelle, tries to slink around unnoticed and mostly hangs out with her best friend, Fareeda (Anjelika Washington), and the smitten Jack (Griffin Gluck). The uneasy status quo shifts when Jodi starts swooning over Stig (Luke Eisner), a Swedish exchange student. In a show of striking imagination, Fareeda and Jack are a free-spirited black girl and a nerdy white boy. Stig, meanwhile, is impervious to American social dictates — or is he? The one exception to the film’s otherwise prefab cast of characters is Jodi’s older sister, Harper (Sabrina Carpenter), who is a beauty queen but nice.  But that’s how things roll in this Netflix movie, which makes Nickelodeon look like Harmony Korine’s “Spring Breakers.”  The director Nzingha Stewart and the screenwriter Sam Wolfson set a mellow pace (to put it kindly), and “Tall Girl” meanders through hackneyed plot points as Jodi struggles to, ahem, stand tall. A big problem is that the students are all affluent and status-obsessed, but the film has no temperament for self-examination: Instead of a John Hughes-style satire of class and social divides — not that acute here, to begin with — we get an uncritical depiction of homogeneous entitlement. That Jodi’s New Orleans high school is named after a real-life civil-rights activist only underlines the film’s obliviousness. America’s mood has changed, and many viewers might not feel much empathy for the small-minded grievances of wealthy teens who drive to school in S.U.V.s. Tall Girl Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes."
157,Ad Astra,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/movies/ad-astra-review-brad-pitt.html,"In “Ad Astra,” an adventure tale weighed down by the burdens of masculinity, Brad Pitt plays an astronaut in flight. The film is a lovely, sincere and sometimes dopey confessional about fathers and sons, love and loss that takes the shape of a far out if deeply inward trip. As in many expeditions, the journey doesn’t simply progress; it stutters and freezes and periodically backslides. Yet each step — the story begins on Earth and soon rockets to the dark side of the moon — is a reminder that in order to get found, you need to get lost. For the most part, the film’s heaviness is a virtue, even when its director, James Gray, slips into grandiosity. It’s also welcome, given how many American movies embrace the trivial as a commercial imperative. Somewhat of a throwback, especially in his commitment to thoughtful adult stories, Gray makes films like “The Immigrant” that are insistently dark — both thematically and visually — about complicated people navigating complex realities. His under-loved last film, “The Lost City of Z,” tracks an early-20th-century explorer who travels far into the Amazon carrying the sins of Western civilization with him. It ends badly. As an exploration of masculinity and its discontents, “Ad Astra,” set in a credible near future, plays very much like a thematic, somewhat obsessive bookend to “The Lost City of Z.” Each film focuses on skilled men who have embraced (with various degrees of knowing) ways of being in the world that have brought them public rewards at personal cost. Much like his Amazon-bound counterpart, Pitt’s astronaut, Maj. Roy McBride, has earned praise and renown, not always comfortably. McBride is also instructively isolated and earthbound when the film opens, a moment which finds him murmuring in voice-over before he scrambles onto, and soon falls from, a dizzyingly high antenna meant to locate extraterrestrial life. The figure of the falling man isn’t new — Adam, Icarus and Don Draper all tumble — though it gained new meaning on Sept. 11 with Richard Drew’s harrowing photograph of an unidentified man plummeting from one of the twin towers. McBride’s plunge visually echoes that heartbreaking picture, although, after spinning around and deploying his parachute, he manages to land. The entire episode foreshadows a longer, more tortuous fall that begins when McBride is sent on a fairly dubious operation in deep space to contact his father (Tommy Lee Jones, in a forceful, Ahab-esque turn). A much-admired astronaut, the father presumably died leading another mission, effectively abandoning his son. Things go badly, of course; they must. Before long McBride has set off — much like his “Lost City of Z” counterpart and Martin Sheen before him in “Apocalypse Now” — on what seems to be another iteration of “Heart of Darkness.” That’s particularly the case when McBride watches transmissions of his father talking about his mission that suggest the older man has gone mad, having succumbed (as Conrad puts it) to “the powers of darkness.” And while McBride has followed in his father’s footsteps, including in a disastrous personal life, the closer he comes to communicating with his dad the more that path looks like a dead end. Visually austere and narratively clotted, “Ad Astra” tends to work best in isolated scenes rather than in the aggregate. It’s a striking film that Gray has washed in soft, vibrant color and filled with geometric patterns that pick up on the beauty (and natural orderliness) of the astronomical wonders that McBride passes and visits during his travels through space. Working with the cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and the production designer Kevin Thompson — and building on work by NASA — Gray creates a persuasive-looking cosmic realm that is familiar enough to latch onto yet also exotic enough to feed the film’s mystery. Pitt’s soulful, nuanced performance — which becomes incrementally more externalized and visible, as if McBride were shedding a false face — holds the film together even when it starts to fray. McBride spends a lot of time alone, as when he’s wearing a spacesuit, his face wholly or partly obscured by his helmet with its golden, mirrored visor. As with McBride’s voice-over, which Pitt delivers in intimate tones — like a lover or penitent whispering confidences in your ear — the helmet alternately reveals and obscures the character, putting the narrative dynamic into visual terms. (Gray shares script credit with Ethan Gross.) There are good moments, strong scenes and brief turns from familiar faces, including Donald Sutherland, a human jolt, sinister and avuncular; and Ruth Negga, as a longtime, unsettled Mars dweller. A tense detour on a space vessel in distress and a chase sequence on the moon are especially effective, just because they pop, creating visceral excitement as well as a necessary contrast to McBride’s hushed, repetitive ruminations. These scenes remind you that Gray can make the screen snap alive, whether he’s unleashing blunt terrors or flipping a racing dune buggy, making you jump in your seat. But Gray also has things to say and, like too many filmmakers, he worries that we’re not listening. So he keeps saying them. The closer that McBride gets to his goal, the more abstract the story becomes and the more uninteresting. In “Ad Astra” — Latin for “to the stars” — Gray takes up a thread that has wound through American cinema for decades: How to be a man in the wake of feminism. McBride’s father represents a stereotypical male ideal, the strong, aloof hero; McBride’s unfortunately named ex, Eve (Liv Tyler), who flickers in and out like a broken promise, is his father’s antithesis. Yet while McBride has emulated his father, the cracks show, as when — after another routine psych exam — he unconvincingly insists that he’s fine, just fine. He is steady and calm, ready to do the job. His heart rate is so low he might as well be in a coma. He is not, although by the time McBride is swimming through a watery tunnel toward a rebirth — complete with a portentous, symbolic umbilical cord — the film is en route to a metaphysical collapse. It’s disappointing, even if an early generic description of the story’s time frame as one of “hope and conflict” has already signaled its shortcomings. That description may be an attempt to establish its universality (or commercial accessibility). Yet what is unmistakable — it’s etched in Pitt’s wounded, crumpled humanity and in Gray’s plaintive earnestness — is that “Ad Astra” is unambiguously a film of its moment, one about a man’s struggle for personal meaning and a place in the world in a time of fallen fathers. Ad Astra Rated PG-13 for mild space violence. Running time: 2 hours 2 minutes."
158,Downton Abbey,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/movies/downton-abbey-review.html,"“Just like the old days,” Cora Crawley, Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern) says, fondly, as “Downton Abbey” gathers all the familiar faces in bustling preparation for an imminent royal visit. Viewers who have faithfully followed the genteel tribulations of the Crawley clan for six seasons of glittering television will need no encouragement from me to re-immerse themselves in the show’s warm bath of privilege. Those who prefer their ablutions minus the scum of entitlement can safely give this big-screen special a miss. The old days, of course (the “good” is silent), are what the Downton universe is selling, a magnificently appointed fantasy of benign aristocracy, grateful underlings and noblesse oblige. Picking up in 1927 shortly after the TV show’s finale, the movie finds the household frantically readying for a lavish dinner, a fancy parade and a grand ball in honor of King George V and Queen Mary. Amid the hubbub, Lady Cora dispenses her usual calming looks and soothing advice, still oblivious to her husband’s seeming preference for the company of his dog. Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) continues to fret, but not too much, over the estate’s financial problems. And Violet, the Dowager Countess (the indispensable Maggie Smith) — always the lemon in the soufflé — is scheming to secure a family inheritance. Below stairs, the Royals’ stuck-up retinue is attempting to supplant the Downton domestics. Daisy (Sophie McShera), the tart kitchen maid, is making eyes at a saucy plumber, and a butler emergency coaxes Carson (Jim Carter), that reliably priggish defender of probity, out of retirement. There’s some petty pilfering, a blink-and-you-miss-it assassination attempt and a bit of bother with a boiler. But it’s all weak tea, with the occasional decorous tilt toward politics (of the Irish-Republican kind) and scandal (of the butler-on-the-down-low kind). This last leads us to a clandestine gay club where a rowdy group of men are deliriously dancing the Black Bottom. It’s easily the movie’s liveliest scene, and the most surprising, not least because the north of England in the 1920s was hardly a gay haven. With barely enough plot to go around, most characters are served a tiny dollop. Lacking the nutritious story lines of the past, the cross-cultural liaisons and the odd inconvenient corpse in Lady Mary’s bedroom, the movie is mainly empty calories. Yet its screenwriter, Julian Fellowes (who created the TV series), knows his stories have always relied less on words than on the looks — arch and knowing, suspicious and appalled — that ricocheted around every social gathering. Choreographing those is the job of the director, Michael Engler, who stretches each raised eyebrow and pursed lip to big-screen proportions, miraculously without turning every close-up into a cartoon. From its spectacularly detailed aesthetic to the characters’ march down well-worn personality paths, “Downton Abbey” argues insistently for the status quo. Lady Mary fleetingly questions the future of the aristocracy, only to be reassured — by a servant, mind you — that she and her ilk are not just relevant, but essential. And when the 1926 General Strike is mentioned, it’s solely to allow Violet to quip that her maid was “rather curt” with her at the time. Supporting a class system as rigid as Violet’s spine, the Downton staff are so devoted to their betters that even when they stage a revolution, its purpose is to deny themselves a night off. You have to admire Fellowes’s ability to turn the sour sauce of oppression and inequality into comfort food. So when Henry Talbot (Matthew Goode) finally sails in, mere minutes before the end credits, to waltz with Lady Mary and assure her that Downton will endure forever, the faithful will likely feel as relieved as she does. Downton Abbey Rated PG for men kissing and women keeping secrets. Running time: 2 hours 2 minutes."
159,Rambo: Last Blood,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/movies/rambo-last-blood-review.html,"Mexico is a North American country of over 700,000 square miles, comprising 31 states. At least that’s the case in our reality. In the reality of “Rambo: Last Blood,” starring Sylvester Stallone as the titular vengeful killing machine, Mexico is a very, very bad neighborhood that’s about a 40-minute drive from the peaceful Arizona ranch where our hero will, if the title of this movie is to be trusted, make his final stand. On this ranch, the aged warrior John Rambo trains horses, forges sharp metal objects and looks after a network of tunnels he has built beneath the house. His motivation for so doing is tied in with his war trauma, and postwar trauma, and all the stuff that happened to him in the multiple other Rambo movies. “First Blood” (1982) was a relatively thoughtful picture about a damaged Vietnam vet, but the sequels were reactionary exercises in bloodletting. While the Mexican villains of this movie suggest some sort of similarly retrograde statement, this picture doesn’t have a political ax to grind so much as a will to go full grindhouse. “I need to go to Mexico,” Rambo’s teen ward Gabriela (Yvette Monreal) announces one morning. “Why would you wanna do that?,” Rambo asks. She has her reasons, and soon after satisfying them, she is drugged and kidnapped by sex traffickers. It’s just the beginning of her ordeal — the poor character is, rather offensively, but a prop to trigger Rambo’s killing rage. He satisfies it by luring the traffickers back to his booby-hatched ranch, where he ticks them off using gory methods derived from oodles of Z movies. While the killings (replete with beheadings, dismemberments and more) are zestfully depicted — the director Adrian Grunberg has a way with pace and bloody impact to be sure — the picture overall is rote, mechanical. With the bad guys dispatched, old Rambo goes to the rocking chair on the ranch house’s porch and reflects on his busy day. The movie goes semi-sepia, and we are treated to misty watercolor memories going back to the first “Rambo” movie; then we’re in full metal jacket Rambo world, with him shooting at people and at other stuff, then we’re back with him on the porch. At which point one expects the movie will loop back again, because why not? Rambo: Last Blood Rated R for face-smashings/removals and all that sort of thing. Running time: 1 hour 29 minutes."
163,Abominable,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/movies/abominable-review.html,"“Abominable” is an exceptionally watchable and amiable animated tale written and directed by Jill Culton. Its opening scene is like that of a first-person video game. From the point of view of something in captivity, we, the audience, break free, bouncing out of a cell and into a lab, where a red-haired female scientist informs us, in a plummy British accent, that we really ought not to be out and about. But further out we go, and soon the P.O.V. segment ends. We see whose eyes we’ve been looking through: a large four-legged creature with snow-white fur, gorgeous sky-blue eyes and a goofy grin. The creature, who gets nicknamed Everest, after the place where it wants to return, at times looks like a not-too-distant relative of Gritty, the lovably outré mascot of the Philadelphia Flyers. He parks on the roof of a small apartment building in China, from where he can see a billboard of his home. There he is discovered by Yi (voiced by Chloe Bennet), a plucky violin-playing tween who’s saving money to embark on a journey that her late father had envisioned for his family. Once she establishes a bond with Everest, she learns of the shady interests that had been keeping him caged. Along with her young friends, Yi gets swept up by Everest on an epic, colorful journey home. Everest is a Yeti, but in this movie Yetis have been substantially reconstituted from those of conventional myth. This one can do magical things, particularly in the wild, where he bonds with nature to grow giant blueberries or conjure a land-borne speedboat that can power through miles-long fields of flowers. These acts are beautiful and exhilarating to behold. So much so, in fact, that one tends not to mind the highly recycled nature of the narrative itself.  Abominable Rated PG for intense chase scenes and Yeti imperilment. Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes."
164,The Laundromat,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/movies/the-laundromat-review.html,"“The Laundromat” is like an enthusiastic high-school teacher — maybe you know the type — who tries to liven up dry material with skits, games and funny costumes. The film’s subject matter could hardly be more urgent: the deep and pervasive corruption of the global financial system, as documented in the 2016 data leak known as the Panama Papers. But the movie, directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Scott Z. Burns, conducts its business with brisk, breezy irreverence. It’s a didactic comedy, an earnest lesson in political economy dressed up as a farce. “The Big Short,” Adam McKay’s 2015 film about the financial crisis that ushered in the Great Recession, is an obvious precedent. Like McKay, Soderbergh and Burns (adapting Jake Bernstein’s book “Secrecy World”) alternate between jaunty, direct-to-camera explanation and vignettes that illustrate relevant concepts and problems. It’s almost literally a textbook approach, when you think about it. All that’s missing are study questions at the end of each chapter. Antonio Banderas and Gary Oldman play Ramón Fonseca Mora and Jürgen Mossack, partners in a Panama City-based law firm that specializes in all kinds of legal, semi-legal and not-really-legal tricks designed to horde, hide and launder the fortunes of the very rich. The two gentlemen appear in tuxes and ice-cream suits, in gold lamé and chalk stripes — the various uniforms of the moneyed elite. They represent a world of wealth without grace or nobility, a transnational ruling class with no class at all. The entitled and the greedy buy what they need and do what they want, without a thought for the consequences. The consequences are borne by ordinary people, here embodied by Meryl Streep with a plain haircut and a flat Midwestern accent. She plays Ellen Martin, a Michigan grandmother whose attempts to do apparently straightforward things like settle an insurance claim and buy a new condo are ensnared in complicated schemes that defy rational comprehension. The companies she deals with are shells within shells, paper entities confected in the Mossack Fonseca offices, where accountability is laundered along with money. The anecdotes assembled to illuminate the firm’s shady practices — and to give context to Ellen’s predicament — would make for tawdry and depressing reading. An expatriate oligarch cheats on his wife with their daughter’s best friend. The wife of a high-ranking Chinese official poisons a British businessman. Corruption is so normal that decency seems outlandish. Soderbergh and his top-notch cast (Sharon Stone shows up, as do Jeffrey Wright and Matthias Schoenaerts) keep things lively, playing out parables of betrayal and deception with pulpy, TV-movie flair. Rather than trying to elicit horror or pity, “The Laundromat” aims to provoke a sense of spirited outrage, the sort of righteous disgust that might express itself through reform-minded citizen action. There’s no reason to be cynical about that. The main question about a movie like this is whether it can awaken viewers who aren’t already in agreement with its perspective and aware of the overall shape of its argument. The second question — the critic’s question, if no one else’s — is whether it succeeds as a movie independent of the merits of that argument. That’s a tricky one. Since he ended his brief retirement from filmmaking in 2017, Soderbergh has plied his craft with scrappy exuberance. Like “Logan Lucky” and “High Flying Bird,” “The Laundromat” has an unpretentious, seat-of-the-pants vibe, even though the story and some of the effects are fairly elaborate. Not everything works. There is a labored surprise involving Streep that seems almost like an act of trolling intended to challenge the liberal good will on which the movie otherwise depends. And Oldman’s German accent is so grating that you may wish Mossack had been the silent partner so Banderas could have done all the talking. But for a movie about how awful the world is and how it got that way, “The Laundromat” is kind of a lark. The Laundromat Rated R. Lucre doesn’t get much filthier than this. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes."
165,Judy,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/movies/playing-with-fire-review.html,"The hero of “Playing With Fire,” Jake Carson (John Cena), is forever pointing out that he’s not a firefighter. He’s a smokejumper, and with the help of his quirky crew, played by John Leguizamo and Keegan-Michael Key, Jake drops from helicopters to put out forest fires. With single-minded focus, he seeks out the most dangerous blazes. Unfortunately, the flat-footed family comedy around him fails to produce sparks. Jake’s hyper-regimentation is challenged when his crew lowers him into a burning cabin. He finds three children huddled in the blaze and takes them into his care at the station. Immediately, the kids, ranging in age from toddler to teenager, make themselves too much at home. Most of the movie’s comedy comes from the chaos of children run amok in fireman’s land. They shoot nail guns and play in the fire simulation room, and their ragamuffin charms quickly win over the grown-ups. Jake warms, abandoning regulation in favor of fun at home and even romance with the scientist gal next door. But despite the novel setting, the director Andy Fickman has made a visually flat film. The editing is frequently awkward, clunkily overemphasizing physical gags, and lingering too long on the actors as they try to light up dusty material. What “Playing With Fire” does get right is its central casting. Cena suits his woodblock character, imbuing the square firestopper with a warmth that seems neither phony nor self-conscious, and the always welcome Judy Greer waves her magic character-actress wand to fill out what might have been a scolding love interest. It’s an unchallenging movie, but as far as unchallenging kids movies go, the actors ensure this one doesn’t fall into soullessness. Playing With Fire Rated PG for action scenes and gross out humor. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes."
167,Joker,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/movies/joker-review.html,"Since its debut a few weeks ago at the Venice Film Festival, where it won the top prize, Todd Phillips’s “Joker” has stirred up quite a tempest. Hands have been wrung about the movie’s supposed potential to inspire acts of real-life violence, and criticism of its brutal nihilism has been met with a counter-backlash, including from Phillips himself, who has been sounding off about the “far left” and “woke culture” and other threats to the ability of a murderous clown to make money unmolested. Meanwhile, the usual armies of skeptics and fans have squared off with ready-made accusations of bad faith, hypersensitivity and quasi-fascist groupthink. We are now at the phase of the argument cycle when actual ticket buyers have a chance to see what all the fuss is about, which means that it’s also time for me to say my piece. And what I have to say is: Are you kidding me? To be worth arguing about, a movie must first of all be interesting: it must have, if not a coherent point of view, at least a worked-out, thought-provoking set of themes, some kind of imaginative contact with the world as we know it. “Joker,” an empty, foggy exercise in second-hand style and second-rate philosophizing, has none of that. Besotted with the notion of its own audacity — as if willful unpleasantness were a form of artistic courage — the film turns out to be afraid of its own shadow, or at least of the faintest shadow of any actual relevance. It barely even works within the confines of its own genre, the comic-book movie. “Joker” is a supervillain origin story, involving a character whose big-screen résumé already includes three Oscar winners (two for other roles, but still). It’s not hard to see the appeal. The Joker, an embodiment of pure anarchy, can be played light or heavy, scary or fun or all at once. He can sneer like Jack Nicholson, snarl like Heath Ledger or … I’m still not sure what Jared Leto was doing, but never mind. As embodied by Joaquin Phoenix, he laughs a lot — enough to ensure that no one else will. The hallmark of this “Joker” is its solemn witlessness. You might wonder how this could be the work of the same Todd Phillips who directed “The Hangover” and “Road Trip,” which have at least a reputation for being funny. The cleverest bit here is casting Robert De Niro as a late-night, Carsonesque talk-show host similar to the one played by Jerry Lewis in Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy.” In that movie, De Niro was the crazy stalker, a talentless wannabe presuming to breathe the same air as his idol and quarry. This time out, he’s in the big chair, feeding the celebrity obsessions of Arthur Fleck. That’s the Joker’s alter ego: a lonely, damaged man eking out an abject living as a clown-for-hire and living in a drab apartment with his mother (Frances Conroy). Phillips, who wrote the script with Scott Silver, takes us back to the bad old days of Gotham City, when work was scarce, rats were rampant and a garbage strike fouled the streets. Fleck is bullied by thieving poor kids and drunken rich guys, goaded to the point of murder by the meanness of the world. He has a crush on a neighbor (Zazie Beetz) that he thinks might be reciprocated. He keeps a notebook full of stand-up material and works up the nerve to go onstage at a nightclub open-mic night. There’s nothing wrong with any of these plot points, or with the details that knit “Joker” into the familiar Batman world. Arthur has a connection to the Wayne family — we meet Alfred the butler and young Bruce — and also to Arkham Asylum. The problems arise when the film revs its allegorical engine and Phoenix tries to assemble a character from the tics and tropes he has been given. Skinny, twitchy and at times startlingly graceful — Phoenix is one of the modern screen’s underrated dancers — Arthur has a physical and psychological resemblance to Freddie Quell, the misfit drifter Phoenix played in “The Master.” But he also carries the burden of being a victimized Everyman in a parable that can’t get its story straight. Arthur’s uncontrollable laughter arises from a medical condition that is possibly the result of childhood abuse. His profound alienation also arises from social inequality, the decline of civility, political corruption, television, government bureaucracy and a slew of other causes. Rich people are awful. Poor people are awful. Joker’s embrace of radical evil becomes a kind of integrity. Or something. It’s hard to say if the muddle “Joker” makes of itself arises from confusion or cowardice, but the result is less a depiction of nihilism than a story about nothing. The look and the sound — cinematography by Lawrence Sher, cello-heavy score by Hildur Gudnadottir — connote gravity and depth, but the movie is weightless and shallow. It isn’t any fun, and it can’t be taken seriously. Is that the joke? Joker Rated R. Killer clown stuff. Running time: 2 hours 2 minutes."
168,Lucy in the Sky,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/movies/lucy-in-the-sky-review.html,"It’s hard to know why anyone thought “Lucy in the Sky,” a drama about an astronaut’s fall, would make a good movie. Was it the appeal of outer space, with its beauties, mysteries and infinite possibilities? Or was it the faintly exotic if rather basic romance that blows up so many lives? Was it the diapers? Inspired by real events, as movies like to say, “Lucy” selectively draws on the bleak story of Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, an astronaut who earned national notoriety in 2007 when she was arrested after attacking Colleen Shipman, an Air Force captain she saw as a romantic rival. Nowak was charged on several counts, including attempted kidnapping; later, she was charged with attempted murder. It was wild and weird. She had gone full-on Jason Bourne for the attack, dressed in a wig and a trench coat, and armed with a BB gun, a steel mallet and a buck knife. But all that anyone cared about were the diapers she said she wore on a long, futile drive the night of the assault. Some of this makes it into “Lucy in the Sky,” which takes curious liberties (no diapers) with the real story to not much point. Its main draws are Natalie Portman, who plays a sympathetic variation on Nowak called Lucy Cola; and Jon Hamm as her swaggering heartbreaker, Mark Goodwin, another astronaut. In their shared and individual scenes, these nicely synced performers create an emotional and psychological foundation for the story that holds your attention even as the rest of the movie collapses around them. It’s a dispiriting mess and waste of talent, sunk by a lack of focus, misguided choices and insistently unproductive, at times incoherent clashing tones. Directed by Noah Hawley, who shares script credit with Brian C Brown and Elliott DiGuiseppi, the movie tracks Lucy from her greatest triumph to her desperate breakdown, all while toggling between outer and inner space. She’s soaring when you first see her, tethered to a shuttle high above the Earth. (A mission specialist, Nowak flew on Space Shuttle Discovery in 2006.) Enveloped by the immensity that folds her in its arms, Lucy looks small and vulnerable. But she’s ecstatic. Flooded with light and complicated feelings that she never manages to articulate, she brings to mind a saint in religious reverie, her eyes and smile as shining, bright and wide as the world. She soon falls to Earth, of course. Reality is a bummer, and so is her dreary life. With its winter browns and crepuscular lighting, her house couldn’t be more uninviting; with his smiles and smothering love, her husband, Drew (Dan Stevens), couldn’t be more absurd. He’s kind and dull, a beatific cipher in a mustache who seems closely modeled on Ned Flanders, the maddeningly decent, cheery neighbor on “The Simpsons.” It’s almost a surprise that Drew doesn’t say “Hi-Diddly-Ho!” at the breakfast table; it’s entirely unsurprising when the lost, drifting Lucy romantically fixes on Mark, a hotshot who seems to take his lifestyle cues from 1960s-era Playboy and soon starts eyeballing another (Zazie Beetz). Hawley throws a lot at the screen, including a gun, a distraction (Pearl Amanda Dickson), a little piquant showboating (from Ellen Burstyn as Lucy’s grandmother) and some reductive ideas about women and power. He tries hard to obscure that this is little more than a sad, small story about a mental health crisis. Mostly, though, he keeps shifting from serious to satirical while restlessly toying with the visuals. In a misguided bid at Expressionism, he dramatically shrinks and expands the aspect ratio, pulling it like taffy, and blurs the inner edges of the frame. All this shape-shifting is mildly diverting at first, but what initially looks like aesthetic adventurousness soon registers as confusion, suggesting that he is finally as unmoored as his heroine. Lucy in the Sky Rated R for a gun, language and attempted crime. Running time: 2 hours 4 minutes."
169,Dolemite Is My Name,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/movies/dolemite-is-my-name-review.html,"“Dolemite Is My Name” starts out as a comedy of failure and foolish hope. When we first meet him, in Los Angeles in the early ’70s, Rudy Ray Moore is a multi-hyphenate might-have-been. As he slides toward middle age, popular culture seems to be running in the other direction. His novelty R&B singles can’t even get played in the record store where he works as assistant manager. His semi-naughty stand-up routine (“What did the elephant say to the naked man?”) is too corny for a generation discovering the matter-of-fact raunchiness of Redd Foxx. Rudy, a real-life actor, comedian and dedicated self-promoter, is played by Eddie Murphy, one of Foxx’s heirs. Murphy’s celebrity, which has faded a bit recently (he’s been scarce on the big screen for a decade or so), both overshadows Moore’s and illuminates it. For much of the movie, we’re being treated to two wildly profane, bracingly inventive performances in one. But more is going on here than just one electrifying comedian impersonating another. There has always been something a little mysterious about Murphy, an edge to his charm, a suggestion of loneliness and suspicion in his eyes. Here, in the midst of mile-a-minute verbal acrobatics and slow-burn slapstick, those eyes register a dimension of sadness — of hunger, of hurt and defiant pride — that the film itself doesn’t really explore. Directed by Craig Brewer from a script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (with Murphy as a producer), “Dolemite Is My Name” sticks to the surface of a rambunctious, sometimes rousing show-business saga in which adversity is faced down, called all kinds of names and triumphantly overcome. It’s a superhero origin story of sorts, sparked by some desperate folkloric research. Rudy, in a last-ditch bid to scare up some new material, tape-records the rhymes, jokes and tall tales of a group of homeless men. Their filthy, braggadocious verbal flights — I wish I could quote just one word — look back to southern black oral traditions and ahead to hip-hop. Accessorizing a series of brightly colored suits with silver-topped canes and feathered fedoras, Rudy reinvents himself as Dolemite, a one-man symphony of outrageous archetypes. Accompanied by drumbeats and keyboard riffs, he spins out insults, sexual boasts and old-time fables, like the story of the signifying monkey. He hits the road, packing nightclubs and juke joints across the South, and releases a series of albums whose salacious covers hint at the exuberant obscenity inside. When Rudy decides to make a Dolemite movie, “Dolemite Is My Name” shifts gears into backstage farce, and Murphy shares the screen with a growing ensemble of accomplices, all of them great fun to watch. Early on, we catch a glimpse of Snoop Dogg as a D.J. — later, Chris Rock will man the microphone at a radio station — but the real scene stealers are Tituss Burgess, Keegan-Michael Key, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Craig Robinson and above all the irreplaceable Wesley Snipes. Snipes plays D’Urville Martin, an accomplished actor whose résumé includes “Rosemary’s Baby” as well as a number of blaxploitation titles. “Dolemite Is My Name” name-checks a few of those movies, and makes clear that by the time Rudy is ready to go into production with “Dolemite,” the blaxploitation genre is ripe for parody. The film he envisions will be a kitchen-sink stew of humor, sex and violence. Kung fu and bare breasts are central to his aesthetic. His screenwriter, Jerry Jones (Key), has aspirations to socially conscious realism. D’Urville, hired to direct as well as to play the heavy, can barely tolerate the amateurish anarchy on the “Dolemite” set. The whole thing seems headed for disaster. Even if you were unaware of the indelible existence of “Dolemite” and its sequels, you wouldn’t be inclined to worry too much. “Dolemite Is My Name” is mostly free of the glowering melodrama and puffed-up machismo of some of Brewer’s other projects (“Hustle & Flow,” “Black Snake Moan”). It has a loose, friendly, house-party vibe, and it’s impossible not to have a good time watching the actors have a good time with one another. If there’s a problem, it’s that the good humor has the effect of lowering the film’s dramatic stakes, and risks turning its cultural reference points into cartoons. Not that the Dolemite character and the “Dolemite” movie weren’t broadly silly and militantly anti-serious. They weren’t only that, though, and one of the striking things about “Dolemite Is My Name” is how hard it works to push history and politics to the margins of the screen. The movie collapses the difference between Rudy Ray Moore and the character he created, treating his creativity as another kind of high-spirited clownishness, and his struggle for recognition as a comic hustle. But if the filmmakers are careless with the dignity of the characters, the actors — Murphy and Snipes in particular — step in to defend it, upholding a tradition at least as old as Hollywood. “Dolemite Is My Name” is not bad, but it isn’t quite what its stars and its subject deserve. Dolemite Is My Name Rated R. Profane poetry. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes."
170,In the Tall Grass,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/movies/in-the-tall-grass-review.html,"Originally published in two parts in Esquire, the novella “In the Tall Grass,” by Stephen King and his son Joe Hill, turns the uniform expanse of rural Kansas into a field that stretches to the horizon in every direction. The field itself has a malevolent presence, like the sentient vines in Scott Smith’s novel “The Ruins,” but just the idea of getting trapped in a sea of green, with the sticky heat and the buzzing flies and the six-foot-tall cuts of grass, is suffocating enough for a short-form shocker. King and Hill sustain the premise for Part 1 before surrendering to abstraction. In the Netflix adaptation, written and directed by Vincenzo Natali, that part lasts only 12 minutes of 102. The rest is a fevered mishmash of spiritual and supernatural nonsense that feels like a trap of another kind, a metaphysical zone defined by arbitrary laws and by characters who are constantly screaming each other’s names. Natali wastes no time parking Cal (Avery Whitted) and his pregnant sister, Becky (Laysla De Oliveira), outside a field in Kansas, where they respond to the cries of a little boy who is lost in the grass. He seems close to the road, but the farther the siblings walk into the green, the farther they seem to get from him — and from each other. As the situation grows more desperate, other figures emerge from the cut, including the boy’s father, played by Patrick Wilson, who tries a clear a pathway by devouring all the scenery he can. Natali whips up an atmospheric frenzy in kind, but every new addition is a subtraction. Two characters condemned to an eternal game of “Marco Polo” is scary enough on its own. In the Tall Grass Not rated. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes."
173,Little Monsters,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/movies/little-monsters-review.html,"When Lupita Nyong’o tells a bunch of kindergartners, “One, two, three, eyes on me,” viewers of “Little Monsters” jolt to attention, too. The charismatic Nyong’o is easily the best part of this feeble Australian horror comedy, arriving Friday to Hulu, as Miss Caroline, a Taylor Swift-crooning, ukulele-strumming teacher who turns fierce when her class is attacked by zombies while on a field trip to a petting farm. Unfortunately, the film’s nominal lead is Dave (Alexander England), a rude, selfish would-be rocker whom the writer-director Abe Forsythe sets on a collision course with utterly predictable redemption: Crushing on a dedicated educator and battling ravenous corpses will do that to the most terminally irritating man-child. When zombies — spawned by an experiment gone wrong at a nearby American military outpost — descend on the koalas and the sheep and the kids, Dave, who tagged along as a chaperone, initially sputters. Faring even worse is Teddy McGiggle (Josh Gad), a superstar children’s entertainer who just happened to be shooting his show at Pleasant Valley Farm. While he reveals himself to be a foul-mouthed mega-jerk, he also lands the film’s single best line, so he is almost (almost) forgiven. In contrast to the hapless men, Miss Caroline never loses her cool and steadfastly dispatches the lurching attackers. By the end, she looks like Mary Poppins after a post-apocalyptic Tough Mudder race — and Nyong’o slays both registers. To Forsythe’s credit, his movie takes place in a universe where people are at least aware of pop culture’s zombie obsession: Dave’s young nephew, Felix (Diesel La Torraca), knows how to stop them, having successfully destroyed them in video games. But “Little Monsters” does not move the needle for the comic-zombie genre, which has not progressed much in the 15 years since “Shaun of the Dead” and the 10 since “Zombieland.” Little Monsters Rated R for profanity and graphic consumption of human flesh.

174,Gemini Man,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/movies/gemini-man-review.html,"I’m a little worried that the premise of “Gemini Man,” which is the most interesting thing about it, might also count as a spoiler. So if you don’t want to know anything about this movie other than that Will Smith plays a super-lethal military assassin hunted by nefarious forces in his own government — which is too much of a cliché to count as a spoiler — then maybe you should move along. Or just watch the trailer, declare the whole thing spoiled, and go about your day. Because what places this globe-trotting action caper, directed by Ang Lee, just a little bit above “utterly forgettable” is the fact that Smith plays more than one assassin. The first one is Henry Brogan, a sniper who has decided to retire after killing dozens of bad guys over the years. Not so fast, Henry! As soon as he settles down in his house on the Georgia coast, gunmen start showing up to terminate his pension. When he gets to Colombia, another would-be killer shows up, but this one — get ready! — is Henry’s own clone. Henry 2.0 is called Junior, and he is also played by Will Smith. He was cultivated by Henry’s former boss, Clay Verris (Clive Owen), a nasty bureaucrat with good taste in art. Junior is 25 years younger than his — original? donor? template? tissue sample? — an effect that has been achieved via digital de-aging, the cinematic trend of 2019. Various techniques to shave off the years were used on Samuel L. Jackson in “Captain Marvel” and on Robert De Niro in “The Irishman.” There is something both unnerving and poignant about seeing these familiar faces turned into younger versions of themselves, because they don’t quite recapture the smooth-faced stars we remember. Junior doesn’t look like the Will Smith of 25 years ago as much as he looks like a 25-year-old who is really, really tired of everyone telling him how much he looks like Will Smith. Junior tries to beat Henry to death with a motorcycle in Cartagena. Later on they trade punches in Budapest. Since a globe-trotting assassin needs someone to banter with and care about, Henry acquires two sidekicks, a younger (but not cloned) operative (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and a grizzled veteran (Benedict Wong). As the three of them uncover the buried secrets about Junior’s background and Verris’s treachery, some philosophical and practical questions arise about how Henry should relate to Junior. Is he a second dad? A big brother? A grouchy uncle? How well does he know the kid, anyway? The answers, tucked into a sludgy script by David Benioff, Billy Ray and Darren Lemke, will not surprise you. What might surprise you, and not happily, is the way “Gemini Man” looks, thanks to Lee’s insistence on using the high-frame-rate 3-D format that he first tried out in “Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk.” The effect is like watching a “Jason Bourne” dinner-theater production in the grip of a migraine. The performances feel slow and deliberate, and the hyper-clarity of the images undermines realism rather than enhancing it. Everything is either too bright or too dim. Action sequences rattle on in murky twilight, and actual places look like cartoons. It takes some work to make Budapest and Cartagena look like generic video-game backdrops, but Lee succeeds. Whatever mystery, intrigue or charm might have percolated in the story and the performances is bleached away by the soulless literalism of the pictures. The partial exception, as I’ve suggested, can be found in Smith’s faces, which haunt each other. The idea of confronting an unknown second self is full of rich, uncanny potential — there’s a literary tradition going back at least to Edgar Allan Poe — but “Gemini Man” squanders it, along with what might have been two interesting performances. Gemini Man Rated PG-13. Dudes fighting, and they might even be the same dude! Running time: 1 hour 57 minutes."
175,The Addams Family,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/movies/the-addams-family-review.html,"In 2019, even the creepiest and kookiest movie characters must have origin stories. The new animated version of “The Addams Family” begins with the wedding of Gomez (Oscar Isaac) and Morticia (Charlize Theron) before they are chased off by angry villagers. Refugees, they wind up in New Jersey and make their home in an abandoned asylum where Thing gives Lurch tips on tickling the ivories. (The pair’s eventual duet on the rock-and-soul standard “Green Onions” is quite the sight.) Although returning the Addamses to illustrated form brings them full circle (Charles Addams’s New Yorker cartoons long predated the 1960s TV series), this movie exists in the shadow of Barry Sonnenfeld’s live-action films from 1991 and 1993. As spot on as the casting of Isaac and Theron may sound, animation spares them from having to match the ingenious physical comedy of Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston. In other respects, the movie — from the “Sausage Party” directors Conrad Vernon and Greg Tiernan — is the diversion you would expect, getting laughs from the disparity between the Addams’ congenital gloominess and the planned community, called Assimilation, that’s being developed near their mansion. (Allison Janney voices the villain, a home makeover guru who is, in her own way, mysterious and spooky.) Pugsley (Finn Wolfhard) nervously prepares for his mazurka, which resembles a bar mitzvah with a saber instead of a Torah portion, while Wednesday (Chloë Grace Moretz) experiences pangs of teenage rebellion, which means adding the “gateway color” pink to her wardrobe. If this installment lays on the moral (all families are freaky in their own ways) a bit thick, it has just enough wit and weirdness to honor its source material. The Addams Family Rated PG. Bright colors, sunshine, happiness. Running time: 1 hour 27 minutes."
176,The King,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/movies/the-kingmaker-review.html,"It was always a little too easy to laugh at Imelda Marcos. The gold and the kitsch, the fine art and the tchotchkes, the rows of bedazzled shoes and the towering dome of shellacked hair — it was all so very much, so very vulgar, so very, very expensive. During the roughly two decades that Marcos was the first lady of the Philippines, she became famous for lavish habits that make the Kardashians seem like skinflints. Even after the Marcos family fled the Philippines in 1986, her extravagance often received more attention than her role in what was called a “conjugal dictatorship.” In the documentary “The Kingmaker,” Lauren Greenfield trots out the plunder and of course the shoes — those notorious emblems of Marcos’s excess — but also examines the appalling costs of that luxury. It’s an ugly story shrewdly told, with a sense of humor and also a deeper feeling for history. In the years since Marcos and her husband, Ferdinand (who died in exile, in Hawaii, in 1989), were ousted after the People Power Revolution, too many journalists have called on her to gawk and dish. Greenfield, a fine-art photographer turned filmmaker, has something else in mind, as telegraphed by the aerial shot of ramshackle Manila shanties that starts the movie. This opener introduces Greenfield’s dialectic approach, which emerges slowly. Under her scrupulous gaze — the directors of photography are Lars Skree and Shana Hagan — Marcos, a.k.a. the Iron Butterfly, floats through her homes, tended to by anxious aides. She chats under a Picasso, poses before a Michelangelo. She displays reams of legal documents from her many court battles and drifts down memory lane, at one point showing off photos of herself with the woman she calls Mrs. Mao (Jiang Qing) and with Richard M. Nixon. When Marcos accidentally knocks over some photos, shattering the glass in the frames, the moment vibrates with metaphoric force.  Greenfield doesn’t explain how she secured her remarkable access, though she clearly has a gift for wrangling the self-obsessed. Her documentary “The Queen of Versailles” (2012) centers on a billionaire couple (primarily its title subject, Jackie Siegel) who planned to build the largest privately owned house in the United States. Perhaps Marcos saw “Queen of Versailles” and liked what she saw. Or maybe she simply wanted the attention to stoke her political ambitions, specifically from a respected chronicler like Greenfield. It’s hard not to wonder if Marcos regarded the filmmaker as another would-be courtier or even an acquisition (a mistake). Whatever the case, as Greenfield quickly reminds you, one way into a narcissist’s heart is to turn on a camera and microphone, and let vanity take over. From the instant that Marcos appears in “The Kingmaker” — gliding through the streets of Manila in a van as if in a mobile throne — it’s obvious that she remains ravenous for attention, whether from the camera or from the indigent people clamoring outside her window. It’s unsurprising that she rarely appears alone here, though it’s unclear if she needs all her helpers or is simply accustomed to armies of servants. This is, after all, a woman who apparently had a maid whose sole job was to care for her jewelry. Despite the early images of conspicuous poverty, Greenfield initially seems to be going somewhat easy on her subject. “During my time, there were no beggars,” Marcos says soon after the movie begins, while cruising past destitute people and rundown streets. Greenfield doesn’t overtly challenge this assertion, perhaps because it’s so ridiculous. Instead, she cinematically builds a case against Marcos by folding in increasingly tough interviews with brutalized anti-Marcos activists and by deploying a surgical attention to detail: images of grasping hands are contrasted with manicured hands holding money; stuffed animals are set against images of real abused wild ones. Marcos, who turned 85 in 2014, the year that Greenfield started shooting, continues to look remarkably robust as the years pass by, never more so than in front of the crowds that swell in size and intensity at the political rallies she attends. As the throngs burgeon, the movie’s tone grows ominous. Marcos’s children enter and exit, flexing their own political power. Her son, Bongbong, runs for vice president. An alliance emerges between her daughter Imee (also a politician) and the current president, Rodrigo Duterte, whose violent, so-called war on drugs has resulted in the deaths of an estimated 20,000 people and international condemnation. As Greenfield opens “The Kingmaker” up, the Philippines’ past and present move uneasily into alignment, and the movie becomes more interesting and far more disturbing. Notably, it also becomes less about one woman, her malevolent charms and quirks, and develops into an unsettling look at imperial power. That said, there are moments when you wish that Greenfield had pushed harder in “The Kingmaker,” say, by taking a closer look at American intervention in the Philippines. But when she interviews an old friend of the Marcoses who chortles about American support for despots, the movie — like his comment — becomes the tragedy it was meant to be.  The Kingmaker Rated R for images of murdered people. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes."
177,Jexi,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/movies/jexi-review.html,"“Jexi,” a comedy written and directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, does not explicitly position itself as a parody of “Her,” the poignant 2013 love story of a man and a very empathetic piece of software. But this movie’s clear play on the premise helps it get off to a fast start. Adam Devine’s Phil is a socially challenged wannabe journalist in San Francisco, working at a website that’s both listicle farm and hard news outlet. (He’s a listicle guy.) When he ruins his smartphone in a meet-cute with a bike shop owner named Cate (Alexandra Shipp), he buys a new one from a remarkably hostile saleswoman (Wanda Sykes). She’s nothing, though, compared to this phone’s virtual assistant, Jexi (voiced by Rose Byrne). After announcing that she’s here to make his life better, she calls him stupid for accepting the phone’s terms and conditions without reading them, and later blurts, “I’m ashamed to be your phone.” For a good half-hour, watching and listening to Phil get roasted by Jexi is solid amusement. Her nastiness is soon revealed as a form of tough love, at least until the device becomes genuinely jealous. “Jexi” was not screened for critics, which is odd. The movie looks like “Moonstruck” next to many of the stinkers gladly offered for reviewing assessment in recent weeks. It’s also, despite some predictably raw sex humor, more amiable than you’d expect from a movie by the writers of “The Hangover.” And while its mode of argumentation gets weaker as the standard-issue boy-meets-girl-meets-carpe-diem plot progresses, the appealing cast and brisk running time help “Jexi” not wear out its welcome. Jexi Rated R for language, drug use, predictably raw sex humor. Running time: 1 hour 24 minutes."
179,Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/movies/maleficent-mistress-of-evil-review.html,"The happily ever after delivered by Disney’s “Maleficent” has vanished like a puff of bilious smoke, as its unhappy, reactionary sequel makes depressingly clear.  Released in 2014, the first movie is a satisfying rethink of “Sleeping Beauty” — both Disney’s and Charles Perrault’s — that showed how intelligent intervention could upend centuries of oppressive ideas about women. In its revisionist take, the titular dark, dangerous fairy played by Angelina Jolie isn’t naturally evil or merely spiteful in bestowing a curse, but exerting her power with a vengeance. Played by Jolie with slinky verve, voluminous wings and two magnificently crowning horns, Maleficent is the earlier movie’s greatest special effect. She’s also its most inspired disruptive stroke, having been wronged once upon a time by a suitor, the type who usually bails damsels out of distress. Instead, he secures the throne by seducing and drugging Maleficent, and then clipping her wings, a startling metaphor of violation. The most bracing thing about the original “Maleficent,” though, is that it shifts the narrative weight from the love between a sleeping princess and a rescuing prince to that between the princess and her fairy godmother. Maleficent is back and so is Jolie, who, with her augmented cheekbones and perfectly calibrated hauteur, remains the only reason to bother with it. Much else has changed and not for the better, whatever this hash insists. At the end of the last installment, Maleficent enthroned her adored surrogate daughter, Aurora (Elle Fanning) — who had grown up to become the cursed and liberated beauty — and given her the Moors, a computer-generated peaceable and enchanted wonderland. Aurora rules benevolently from her flower throne, smiling over a menagerie of flowery, floofy and leathery creatures great and small, cutesy and stately. The sequel’s problems are tipped by its title, “Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,” which sounds as if our great horned one had landed a gig as a dominatrix. More worryingly, it suggests that, contrary to what you learned last time, Maleficent is, yes, very bad, a gambit that’s presumably meant to keep new viewers guessing about her character. But if she is evil, as this sequel promises, it makes you wonder about all the other dismal, stubbornly enduring clichés that the first movie jettisoned, specifically that reliably sexist duo: the wicked female usurper whose power inherently challenges ye olde patriarchy and the innocent maiden who needs a prince to rescue her. You don’t wait long to be disappointed. Generic from start to finish, the sequel was directed by Joachim Roenning, whose credits include the forgettable sea adventure “Kon-Tiki” (I had to look it up, and I reviewed it), which is probably what got him the job heading up the most recent “Pirates of the Caribbean” installment. It made a mint and that may explain why he was tapped for “Mistress of Evil,” though he does little but move stuff around, leaving the heavy lifting to Jolie and armies of special-effects workers. (The writers are Linda Woolverton, who wrote the original movie — and whose voice is scarcely heard — Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue.) If “Mistress of Evil” had any of its predecessor’s flashes of self-aware humor, embellished beauty or basic filmmaking intelligence, it might be easier to take or at least ignore. But it’s a clotted mess. It’s also dispiriting because it has traded a fairy tale about female solidarity for a war movie about what happens when women assume power. It opens with a bent knee and ends with an ever-after kiss, but much of the rest is a convoluted brawl filled with noise and computer minions who are tossed like darts. At center is a grasping, malignant queen (Michelle Pfeiffer), the very stereotype that the first movie rejected. She even comes with an awful mini-me (Jenn Murray). Female villains have long been useful scapegoats, repositories for social and cultural anxieties about men, women and power. The original “Maleficent” pushes against that stereotype with a protagonist who’s at once hero and villain, which means that she’s finally neither. Much like “Frozen,” it insists that women can be complex and that even a princess doesn’t need a prince to justify her life. Women can work together, love one another, find their own way. In 2014, when Maleficent — rather than the prince — delivered the kiss that roused Aurora, it felt like an awakening. This new flick doesn’t just feel like a retreat, it also feels like a poisoned, candied invitation to sleep. Maleficent: Mistress of Evil Rated PG for bloodless war violence. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes."
180,Zombieland: Double Tap,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/movies/zombieland-double-tap-review.html,"Tallahassee, the senior zombie-killer played by Woody Harrelson in “Zombieland: Double Tap,” has a catchphrase that’s a little too naughty for me to quote. You’ve probably heard it before, and you might agree with another character’s assessment: “That saying is very 2009.” The whole movie is very 2009, which is amusing and puzzling and possibly kind of a relief, given what “very 2019” might look like. But has it really been a whole decade since “Zombieland,” in which Harrelson joined forces with Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin to crack wise while the skulls of the undead exploded around them? Apparently it has, though part of the charm of this undemanding sequel (directed, like the first one, by Ruben Fleischer) is that it treats 10 years like 10 minutes. During the hiatus, Stone won an Oscar and Eisenberg published a book of stories called “Bream Gives Me Hiccups,” but you’d never know that to see them back again as Wichita and Columbus, shacking up in the Lincoln Bedroom of the White House. In the post-apocalyptic world, there’s no history, and the filmmakers (Dave Callaham, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick share script credit) wisely refrain from calibrating too many jokes to the present-day world beyond the screen. There’s a pretty funny riff about Uber, which is a brainstorm the dumbest character comes up with. Everyone else thinks it’s a stupid idea. This is funny on many levels. “Zombieland: Double Tap” is usually content to be funny on just one. Like the first episode, but even more so, this chapter is aware that zombies are a pop-culture cliché and is content to goof on that fact. There’s nothing here to rival the thing with Bill Murray in “Zombieland” — after all this time, it still feels like a spoiler to say much about it — but the performers commit to the silliness in a spirit of well-compensated affability. Nobody works too hard, including the new faces on hand to refresh the franchise. They include Rosario Dawson, Luke Wilson, Avan Jogia, Thomas Middleditch and Zoey Deutch. Deutch is the principal scene stealer, playing Madison (it’s a “Zombieland” tradition that everyone has the name of an American city), who has survived the undead onslaught in the freezer of a shopping-mall frozen-yogurt store. Madison is blond and not very smart, and Deutch brings remarkable energy and wit to a dreary stereotype. Other satirical targets — Elvis, hippies — are about as fresh. But the zombie gore and the verbal pepper is sprayed quickly enough to keep boredom at bay. “Zombieland: Double Tap” sets the bar low and steps easily over it, which makes it better than a lot of recent big-screen comedies. It doesn’t have much on its mind, but it isn’t completely brain-dead either. Zombieland: Double Tap Rated R. Self-congratulatory profanity. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes."
181,Jojo Rabbit,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/movies/jojo-rabbit-review.html,"According to a child psychologist cited in a recent article in The Atlantic, “little boys’ imaginary friends are frequently characters who are more competent than they are, such as superheroes or beings with powers.” That more or less describes the case of 10-year-old Johannes (Roman Griffin Davis), who has dreamed up a powerful pal to boost his confidence at anxious moments, always ready with a fist pump or a shout of “you got this!” Perfectly normal, and even kind of adorable, even though Johannes’s imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler. The make-believe Hitler is somehow both the most outlandish and the most realistic thing about “Jojo Rabbit,” Taika Waititi’s new film. Based on the novel “Caging Skies” by Christine Leunens — and featuring Waititi himself as Johannes’s goofball fantasy-Führer — the movie filters the banality and evil of the Third Reich through the consciousness of a smart, sensitive, basically ordinary German child. Veering from farce to sentimentality, infused throughout with the anarchic pop humanism Waititi has brought to projects as various as “Hunt for the Wilderpeople” and “Thor: Ragnarok,” it risks going wrong in a dozen different ways and manages to avoid at least half of them. Johannes, raised in a small town in Germany on a diet of propaganda and official Nazi youth culture, has turned Hitler into an emotional support figure, a confidant whose silliness is partly the mirror of the boy’s own insecurities. There are the serial humiliations of Hitler Youth day camp to contend with. Runty and timid, with halfhearted dreams of growing into an Aryan warrior, Johannes is bullied and teased. His nickname, Jojo Rabbit, isn’t meant affectionately. The buffoons who run the camp, an unhinged Valkyrie (Rebel Wilson) and a washed-out storm trooper (Sam Rockwell), are hardly ideal role models, and not only for the obvious ideological reasons. They are less terrifying than the ghoulish local Gestapo man, played by Stephen Merchant. Luckily, Johannes has a kindhearted mother, Rosie (Scarlett Johansson), who is immune to the seductions of National Socialism. (He also has a nonimaginary friend, Yorki, played by a scene-stealing young comic dynamo named Archie Yates.) The extent of Rosie’s opposition reveals itself slowly to Johannes and the viewer, whose point of view remains anchored in the bright colors and magical thinking of the child’s perspective. Still, we know more about what’s happening than he does, not only because we’re aware of the history he is living in, but also because we’re familiar with the contours of his type of coming-of-age story. At stake are Jojo’s innocence and his decency, and how one is purchased at the cost of the other. He needs to outgrow his selfishness and acquire the resources of empathy. Rosie can teach him a little, but his real education comes through his relationship with Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie), a Jewish teenage girl with artistic inclinations whom Rosie has hidden in a crawl space in their house. In Elsa’s presence Jojo is by turns resentful, afraid, infatuated and possessive. The tumult of his feelings, beautifully realized by the 11-year-old Davis, gives the film sweetness and charm as well as a sense of ethical urgency.  Sweetness and charm may not be the notes you want or expect in a movie about genocide and fascism, and there are times when the mood turns sticky and soft, straying a bit too close to the cloying kitsch of Roberto Benigni’s “Life Is Beautiful.” Waititi is trying for a tricky blend of tones, and “Jojo Rabbit” is sharpest when it dares to be funny. Laughter is inherently violent as well as potentially soothing, and the most farcical aspects of Jojo’s world are also the most terrifying. Without resorting to graphic imagery or replicating the sadism of its villains, the movie paints a credible, if unabashedly cartoonish, picture of the workings of an evil system. The particulars of the evil can seem curiously abstract, and the portrayal of goodness can feel a bit false, and forced. The outlandishness of anti-Semitism is emphasized — the idea that Jews have horns, for instance — to the exclusion of its less superstitious manifestations. And Elsa’s Jewishness has no real content. She exists mainly as a teaching moment for Johannes. Her plight is a chance for him to prove his bravery. This isn’t offensive, exactly — the spirit of the movie is too warm and the filmmaking intelligence too invigorating to provoke a strong objection — but it is a little disappointing. The humor is so audacious and the psychological insight at times so startling that it’s hard not to be dismayed when an easy and familiar dose of comfort is supplied at the end. This “Rabbit” is maybe just a little too cute, and a little too friendly. Jojo Rabbit Rated PG-13. Nazis. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes."
182,The Lighthouse,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/movies/the-lighthouse-review.html,"Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson have two of the most mesmerizing — and pleasurably unnerving — physiognomies in movies. In “The Lighthouse,” a sly American Gothic set in the late 19th century, the director Robert Eggers lights and frames the actors to emphasize every bony plane, every facial crease, hollow and pinprick of stubble. The stark black-and-white cinematography deepens the film's shadows and unease, but it also throws these grizzled faces into relief, sharpening their cheekbones and revealing the death’s head under each man’s grimace. A horror movie about inner and outer darkness, the film begins with two lighthouse workers, Wake (Dafoe) and Winslow (Pattinson), arriving on a small, desolate island. Over many solitary days and nights, they work, eat, drink and dig at each other, establishing a bristling antagonism born of temperament and boredom or maybe just narrative convenience. Wake likes to yammer, but the men aren’t ready conversationalists. In time, their minds and tongues are loosened by alcohol and perhaps a simple human need for companionship. The wind howls, the camera prowls, the sea roars and Eggers flexes his estimable filmmaking technique as an air of mystery rapidly thickens. Much as he did in his shivery feature debut, “The Witch,” about an isolated family of fundamentalists coming unglued in early 17th-century America, Eggers makes the secluded world in “The Lighthouse” at once recognizable and eerily unfamiliar, a combination that draws you in but makes you feel unsettled. (He shares script credit with Max Eggers, his brother.) The image of the lighthouse evokes visions of high seas and storms as well as the promise of safe passage and harbor. But here, that romantic idea soon sours. Looming against the perennially gray sky this brick tower looks utilitarian and ominous, a twin to the 19th century’s industrial smokestacks. An old salt with alarmed hair and a wedge-shaped beard worthy of Melville, Wake is the veteran keeper of the lighthouse flame, the guardian of its traditions, language and superstitions. (Never ever kill a sea gull, he cautions.) Dafoe’s mercurial movements, his rippling face and spooky smiles, dovetail beautifully, articulating Wake’s moods and adding to the destabilization. He barks orders, sings a shanty, indulges in sentimentality and turns his yowling mouth into an abyss. To Winslow’s mounting irritation, Wake also guards the key to the lantern room, a glowing, near-mystical chamber with a magnificent prism that provides the film with blasts of bright light. With control and precision, expressionist lighting and an old-fashioned square film frame that adds to the claustrophobia, Eggers seamlessly blurs the lines between physical space and head space. The men in “The Lighthouse” don’t use the therapy-speak of contemporary American cinema (or life) with its endless overexplaining. Instead, Wake and Winslow come into focus through guttural exchanges, their physicality (farting, sweating, straining) and their built and natural environments. The sparse grass and rocky outcrops, the cramped rooms and vertiginous stairs speak to the men’s existential condition — the hardness, confinement and downward spiraling — while (as in “The Witch”) a menacing animal suggests a supernatural threat. Early on, Wake strips — as if to bathe in the lighthouse’s radiance  — and the story takes a turn for the amusingly perverse as trouble starts creeping around the edges. The men’s antagonism deepens as Wake jabbers and Winslow rages, a fury that Pattinson makes visible with eyes that widen into bulges and tremors of emotion that ping under a masklike vacancy. One man masturbates in a frenzy; at another point, he spies on the other grinding alone. The men’s sloppy, alcohol-saturated time together produces intimacy but also menace. They laugh, descending into riotous drunkenness and finding connection that both they and Eggers skitter around. The film itself doesn’t so much deepen as continue to glide on its seductive surfaces and teasing promise. “The Lighthouse” is largely without women. But their traces are strewn throughout, surfacing in the men’s anecdotes (their stories obscure as much as they reveal) and in a mermaid figurine that Winslow finds. He retrieves the crude statuette through a tear in his mattress, digging it out of the hairy stuffing with probing fingers that Eggers — who has the eye of a miniaturist — shows in close-up. (The scene evokes Harvey Keitel stroking a hole in Holly Hunter’s stocking in “The Piano,” another 19th-century Gothic tale.) For Winslow, the mermaid is a fetish, a replacement for something that remains elusive and that — as a flashback suggests — he can’t fully voice. The story in “The Lighthouse” is thin enough to invite plentiful interpretations about masculinity, homosocial relations and desire, even if its more suggestive theme is Wake’s punishing exploitation of Winslow. (It recalls Leslie Fiedler’s observation that “the proper subject” of the American Gothic is slavery.) The film’s more sustained pleasures, though, are its form and style, its presumptive influences (von Stroheim’s “Greed,” German Expressionism), the frowning curve of Winslow’s mustache, the whites of eyes rolled back in terror. Eggers meticulously sets the scene, adds texture and builds tension and mystery from men locked in battle and sometimes in embrace.  He has created a story about an age-old struggle, one that is most satisfyingly expressed in this film’s own tussle between genre and its deviations. The Lighthouse Rated R for nudity, salty language and violence toward animals. Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes."
183,Wounds,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/movies/wounds-review.html,"It starts with an innocent-looking cellphone in a yellow case with pink heart stickers. Innocent-looking. But that little device, which is the centerpiece of the movie “Wounds,” is more potent than you might imagine. The same is true of the giant, high-speed, Southern-style flying cockroaches that pervade this film, which begins streaming Friday on Hulu. If you’ve seen these monsters, you know to fear them the moment the first one appears, scuttling up a bottle at the New Orleans dive where Will (Armie Hammer) tends bar at night.  It is there, a bar called Rosie’s, that Will finds and pockets the phone, fished from among the shards of glass left after a brawl.  Some puzzling, even chilling texts pop in, and he feels compelled to answer. Then he is invited to see the “pretty pictures,” photos of dead bodies and worse. When his girlfriend, Carrie (Dakota Johnson), notices his absorption with the phone, he tries to explain it away.  But the more he sees, the more the normally affable Will suffers inside, his civility giving way to confused rage. Hammer maneuvers his character nimbly as Will skates on the edge of reality, lapsing into hallucinations or fugue states — or something more sinister. Carrie, a college student, gets drawn in, too, and not in a healthy way. The idea of the phone as a place where technology and the otherworldly meet attracts the researcher in her. Just bear in mind that Carrie is writing a paper on T.S. Eliot’s “The Hollow Men.” And “Wounds” begins with an epigraph from “Heart of Darkness” about a man who is “hollow at the core.”  When Will swaggers into Rosie’s by day, showing his boss (Rosie, of course) his increasingly uncontrolled fury, she asks, “What’s gotten into you?” What indeed. It’s regrettable that the writer-director Babak Anvari didn’t draw on the rich history of the occult in New Orleans to add texture to his film. Nor did he drench it in New Orleans music or local accents. There’s not even a single beignet (but there is a pool-playing naked woman at Rosie’s). “Wounds” was filmed on location, but we catch only glimpses of the city and scarcely feel the heat. It could be anywhere. Anywhere with extra-large roaches, that is. The lack of local color notwithstanding, the movie more than fulfills its promise to unsettle and to incite shivers — and it doesn’t quit. Wounds Rated R for gaping wounds, violence and brief nudity. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes."
184,Black and Blue,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/movies/black-and-blue-review.html,"A supremely stressful day in Alicia West’s life — she will be shot at, betrayed and hunted by ruthless men on both sides of the law — begins with a morning jog through a quiet New Orleans neighborhood. Head down, earbuds in, minding her business, Alicia is stopped and frisked by police officers because she “fits the profile.” In other words, because she’s black. But when one of the patrolmen runs her identification, he tells his partner to let her go because “she’s blue,” i.e. one of their colleagues on the force. This is a blunt, efficient way for “Black and Blue” — a blunt, efficient thriller directed by Deon Taylor — to explain its title and its theme. Played by Naomie Harris with a quiet intensity that has room for notes of sorrow and confusion, Alicia is defined by an identity crisis that is hardly hers alone. For reasons that are partly temperamental and partly a matter of sheer bad timing, she’s caught up in an especially lethal set of contradictions involving her job and her race. Alicia, who has come home to New Orleans after combat duty in Afghanistan and the death of her mother, is a rookie and a bit of a loner, though she seems to have a decent rapport with her partner, Kevin (Reid Scott). Because of her job, people she grew up with treat her with coldness and suspicion, in particular her former best friend, Missy (Nafessa Williams). Milo (Tyrese Gibson), the manager of a grocery store, who goes by “Mouse,” is a little friendlier, but he also makes it clear that the line that separates them isn’t one he can comfortably cross. As the engine of its plot starts revving up, the movie takes in some of the realities of American life with matter-of-fact weariness. The scars of Katrina — and of the neglect and corruption that followed — are still evident, and the alienation of poor, black citizens is painful and profound. Alicia wants to believe something else is possible, that common ground exists, that people don’t have to be classified as “allies or enemies,” but this modest idealism only emphasizes her isolation. Rhetoric that once sounded hopeful and inspiring now sounds naïve. She’s hardly foolish or starry-eyed, but her desire not to succumb completely to cynicism means that no one else trusts her. It also endangers her life. How that comes about isn’t something I’m inclined to spoil, though it isn’t hard to figure out what’s going on or what’s coming next. Alicia stumbles on a bunch of dirty cops, led by a narcotics detective who goes by Malone (Frank Grillo), doing some terrible things, which happen to be captured by her body camera. Malone and his crew are mixed up with a drug gang (its leader is played by Mike Colter), and before long both groups are chasing her through alleys and housing projects. Rather than dress up its action with tricky, too-clever plot twists, “Black and Blue” respects both Alicia’s and the viewer’s intelligence. It doesn’t take too long to figure out who the bad guys are, or to see where the next bit of treachery will come from. Alicia and the reluctant Mouse are caught up in a conspiracy so vast and deeply rooted that it seems like part of the city’s infrastructure. That’s a depressing thought, and Alicia is an apt heroine for a time of dread, disappointment and diminished expectations. I don’t mean to make the movie sound altogether grim. Taylor is good at choreographing violence and orchestrating suspense, and also at finding the grain of humor in each performance. He showed all of these skills earlier this year in “The Intruder,” a real-estate thriller that flirted with some of the social implications that “Black and Blue” commits to without reservation. The politics here are elemental and undeniable without being preachy or pretentious. There are one or two soapbox moments, including a self-justifying speech by the principal villain, that could have been left out, but to say as much is really just to note how tight and coherent the movie otherwise succeeds in being.  Sometimes genre entertainment can illuminate troubling realities better than more earnest and self-seriously realistic films, and “Black and Blue” belongs to that tradition. Its pulpy pop-cultural credibility is inseparable from its honest, brutal assessment of the state of the world. Its ideas about the nature and limits of heroism — about just how hard and terrifying the resistance to evil can be — are spelled out in vivid black and white. Black and Blue Rated R for swearing and shooting. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes."
185,The Current War,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/movies/the-current-war-review.html,"A bucket of Oscar bait that’s been sitting around for some two years, “The Current War” may still find an audience. And it should: The film certainly doesn’t reek of failure. But as its energetic early scenes give way to a sluggish second half, you start to sense how much better this good-enough movie might have been.  Beginning in 1880, the story centers on the rivalry between Thomas Edison (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George Westinghouse (Michael Shannon) as they race to wire American cities for electricity. Edison is a proponent of direct current, while Westinghouse pushes alternating current. (Even if you have trouble plugging in a toaster, don’t worry: Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, the film’s director, makes their conflict clear enough, using sweeping music and sharp camera angles to tell us how to feel.)  Side stories abound. We meet Nikola Tesla (Nicholas Hoult, underused, as is Katherine Waterston as Westinghouse’s wife, Marguerite), J.P. Morgan (Matthew Macfadyen) and Samuel Insull (Tom Holland), Edison’s personal secretary. They and other famous figures pop in and out as Michael Mitnick’s script moves to its finale, where the two adversaries arrive at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. If the plot doesn’t always pulse with excitement, the rest of the biopic screams prestige project: sumptuous sets and handsome costumes fill this period piece. There are also a few smart parallels to today’s celebrity entrepreneurs, and to a world undergoing rapid technological change. The film was scheduled for release in late 2017 by the Weinstein Company. After accusations of sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein led to his company’s bankruptcy, the movie was sold to another studio. There were reshoots and re-edits, and additional delays. The film is now being released with the subtitle “Director’s Cut” to distinguish it from the version that premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2017 under Weinstein’s hand.  Cumberbatch cleverly embodies the ambitious Edison, who’s not above sacrificing a few pesky morals for success, nor using his fame to manipulate the media. (A scene where he first lights up a section of Manhattan is beautifully bold.) Shannon is restrained yet charismatic in a role that could have easily been overplayed. For sure, everyone here is fun to watch, making it all the more irksome when, perhaps a half-hour before the end, the film runs short of things to say. The Current War: Director’s Cut Rated PG-13. Running time: 1 hour 47 minutes."
187,The Kill Team,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/movies/the-kill-team-review.html,"In “The Kill Team,” the director Dan Krauss has made a dramatized version of his 2014 documentary of the same title; it explores the same events from a different angle, but with less impact. Both movies concern a case from about a decade ago in which five American soldiers were accused of murdering Afghan civilians. Calvin Gibbs, the staff sergeant whom the documentary presents as a driving force behind the killings, received a life sentence. The principal point of the earlier film was that a specialist, Adam C. Winfield, who received a three-year sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter deserved more lenient treatment because he had tried to blow the whistle on his fellow soldiers. When your comrades are committing murders in a war zone, the documentary argued — letting Winfield off the hook too easily — not going along with them means risking getting killed yourself. More of a companion piece than a substitute, the fictionalized version (names have been changed) tries to show the pressure mounting on a soldier called Andrew Briggman (Nat Wolff), as he is intimidated by a bloodthirsty new sergeant, Deeks (Alexander Skarsgard). Deeks enthralls his men with the promise of making each one “a warrior.” He enforces a rigid code of silence, undercutting Briggman’s self-esteem and turning the men against one another. This present-tense perspective is useful, but while the leads are credible, the filmmaking (including a hacky score) adds a sheen of macho familiarity to a narrative that was eerily matter-of-fact in doc form. Dramatizing these events makes them seem isolated — a bad-apples incident. The documentary had a more haunting implication: If you train soldiers for Hollywood-ready combat, violence on peacekeeping missions becomes inevitable. The Kill Team Rated R for murder and gruesome trophies from killings. Running time: 1 hour 27 minutes."
188,The Gallows Act II,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/movies/the-gallows-act-two-review.html,"Contemporary horror films, often ruthless in their eagerness to deliver the ostensible scary goods, frequently decline to adhere to their own internal logic. “The Gallows Act II,” a thoroughly undistinguished follow-up to the 2015 film “The Gallows,” seems, for much of its running time, not to have any internal logic to begin with. After a found-footage-style prelude establishing the telekinetic, or whatever it is, power of the play-that-kills called “The Gallows,” the movie, written and directed, as the first one was, by Chris Lofing and Travis Cluff, brings us into a fresh world of high-school drama. The eager aspiring actress Auna (Ema Horvath, who has a touch of young Hilary Swank) moves in with her older sister to attend a new high school with a stellar drama department. Auna is pointed to the cursed play by an anonymous subscriber to her YouTube channel. Her discovery of it leads her to some inspired monologuing — being semi-possessed by supernatural evil makes you a better actor, everybody knows that — as well as some scary new videos in which bedroom objects fly around and a masked hangman inexplicably turns up in the background. After which it’s 80 minutes or so of rhyme-and-reason-free gotcha’s, augmented by the bland presence of Auna’s impossibly square-jawed new beau, Cade (Chris Milligan). The movie’s finale offers a twist that ostensibly ameliorates the internal-logic complaints. But it most vividly registers as a rancid misogynist cherry atop a sloppy concoction of tired jump scares. The Gallows Act II Rated R for themes, violence, tired jump scares. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes."
189,Terminator: Dark Fate,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/movies/terminator-dark-fate-review.html,"There are a number of reasons to like “Terminator: Dark Fate” — Linda Hamilton’s scowl, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s stubble, MacKenzie Davis’s athleticism — but my favorite thing about this late addition to a weary franchise is how little it cares about timeline continuity. The dire future of machine rule, prophesied in the first “Terminator” way back in 1984, has been evaded, revised and reinstated in many sequels since then. Judgment Day was coming, until it was canceled. Or maybe just postponed? Skynet was going to obliterate humanity under its cybernetic boot, or maybe just squish us into obedience. John Connor was Christian Bale. Also Nick Stahl. His mother died of Leukemia. T-800 decided to be nice. He was elected governor of California. This is not “Star Wars.” The fans are pretty easygoing. Nothing is really canon. In “Dark Fate,” for example, it turns out that Skynet never happened. It also turns out not to matter. Because one thing is certain, whatever the chronology: Our brainy, idiotic species will create a technology that either enslaves us or wipes us out altogether. (Are you reading this on your phone? See what I mean?) We’ll have to engage in some desperate feats of guerrilla engineering in order to survive. This time around, the entity that isn’t Skynet will have made — the “Terminator” franchise is murder on verb conjugations — killer robots far worse than the models sent from previous futures. Luckily, the scrappy human remnant in this other future gets — will get, would have gotten — hold of time-travel technology and also the ability to create “augmented” fighters with some of the lethal characteristics of their android enemies. It makes as much sense as it needs to. The upshot is naked people falling out of the sky in Mexico City, a very popular destination these days. One of them is an augmented human soldier named Grace (Davis). The other is a Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna), who can take the form of any human being he touches, can split himself in two — the alter ego is a skeletal metal biped — and can reconstitute himself out of oily black ooze. Luna has an odd, dangerous charm. Robert Patrick’s T-1000 is a Pokémon compared to this guy. Anyway, to make a somewhat-too-long story short: Grace has been dispatched to protect an unsuspecting woman named Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), whom the Rev-9 has been sent from the future to kill. Just like in the old days, but with a few interesting wrinkles. It happens that the bad old Skynet future left behind a few loose ends; to wit, the original Sarah Connor and her old nemesis T-800, who now goes by the name Carl and has a drapery business in Texas. He has mellowed. Sarah has not. The “Terminator” movies long ago gave up residence on the action-movie cutting edge. This one, directed by Tim Miller (“Deadpool”), has some solid, well-executed chase and fight sequences — on Mexico City’s roads and in a maquiladora early in the story, and around a hydroelectric dam later on. A complicated, semi-climactic battle inside an airborne cargo plane didn’t work as well for me: too dark, too noisy, too cavalier in its disregard for the laws of physics. Which, I know, is an odd nit to pick when considering a film built on time travel, bioengineered soldiers, rapacious AI and Arnold Schwarzenegger describing himself as “extremely funny.” He is, by the way, or at least engagingly witty. And he’s happy to be helpful and discrete — like a muscular, second-amendment Roomba — leaving the real heroism and most of the snappy catchphrases to Sarah, Dani and Grace. Back in the day, Sarah was a Madonna figure, mother of the last, best hope for mankind. Now she is reborn as a different kind of matriarch, the leader of a tribe of women warriors. Dani, who seems at first to have been chosen to duplicate Sarah’s role in the early movies, is really an update and a revision of the archetype, answering to the feminism of the present and perhaps of the future as well. Terminator: Dark Fate Rated R. Rage against the machines. Running time: 2 hours 8 minutes."
190,Motherless Brooklyn,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/movies/motherless-brooklyn-review.html,"Lionel Essrog — people also call him Brooklyn, and sometimes Freakshow — is a New York gumshoe, plying his trade in the 1950s. The Dodgers are still in Brooklyn, though Walter O’Malley is threatening to move them to California. The cars are boxy, the men wear fedoras, steam rises from the manhole covers and jazz wafts through the air. But Lionel, played by Edward Norton, who also wrote and directed “Motherless Brooklyn” (loosely adapted from Jonathan Lethem’s novel of the same name) is tenderhearted rather than hard-boiled. He has some problems with his brain, a condition he likens to living with “an anarchist” who happens to be relentlessly detail-oriented. (Lethem specifies Tourette’s syndrome; the movie doesn’t hazard a diagnosis.) Lionel’s physical twitches and tics are often accompanied by bursts of wordplay that are more poetic than profane. They are sometimes played for comedy, though not in a cruel way — Norton is as protective of the character’s dignity as Lionel is solicitous of the vulnerable souls who come his way — and sometimes mined for morals. “Name it, claim it, shame it!” Lionel spouts involuntarily during a late showdown with the chief bad guy. That could serve as a tag line, with “it” referring to the abuses of power that Lionel finds as he tries to unravel an especially vexing case, one involving him and everyone he cares about. The buzzing mind that has cursed him with social awkwardness has also blessed him with a photographic memory and superior powers of pattern recognition, so he is able to piece together a puzzle that stretches from the city’s meanest neighborhoods to its pinnacles of privilege and authority. Admirers of Lethem’s novel may find themselves puzzled by what Norton has done with it. He has moved the action backward in time and dramatically expanded its scope, replacing modesty, irony and charm with earnest, sometimes overstrained ambition. But filmmakers don’t owe literary works their reverence, just their intelligence, and “Motherless Brooklyn” is a very smart movie, bristling with ideas about history, politics, art and urban planning. Norton’s taste in collaborators and themes is impeccable. The musical score, with its Elmer Bernstein echoes, is by Daniel Pemberton, and is supplemented by Wynton Marsalis’s fresh, precise interpretations of period-appropriate jazz classics. The big cast, playing a sprawling cross-section of the metropolitan population, is a remarkable collection of talent. The actors glide in and out of moments that are by turns intimate, absurd, frightening and poignant. The autumnal images were gathered by the great cinematographer Dick Pope. I’m trying to postpone saying why it doesn’t all quite work. Lionel is one of a handful of shamuses — Bobby Cannavale, Ethan Suplee and Dallas Roberts play the others — known as Minna’s men. Frank Minna (Bruce Willis), their boss, rescued them from an orphanage when they were young, and trained them to be private detectives. A meeting with some unsavory clients goes wrong and Frank ends up dead, leaving behind his business and a widow (Leslie Mann) who seems less than entirely heartbroken. It’s up to Lionel to figure out what happened. A trail of clues, hunches and accidents leads him down a rabbit hole of political intrigue and double-dealing. He finds himself mixed up with equal-housing activists (Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Cherry Jones), a jazz trumpeter (Michael Kenneth Williams), a Harlem nightclub owner (Robert Ray Wisdom) and a wild-eyed ranter (Willem Dafoe). Somehow it all connects to Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin), the unelected power broker and master builder who runs the city with a ruthless hand and absolute confidence in his own vision. Randolph, played with the bullying dynamism that is Baldwin’s finest, strongest note, is traced over the likeness of Robert Moses, a storied and polarizing figure in New York history. Norton places him, plausibly enough, at the center of a tale of large-scale malfeasance and personal vice that suggests a variation on “Chinatown.” Postwar New York real estate takes the place of Depression-era Los Angeles water as the all-consuming obsession at the heart of the story. Lionel is the little guy who sticks his nose where it doesn’t belong and sniffs out the corruption of the big shots — the racism, petty cruelty and sexual depravity underneath the grand conspiracies. His decency is the axis on which the story turns, and also the movie’s principal flaw. Lionel goes into battle without the armor of cynicism that most movie private eyes before him have worn; instead, he is clad in a righteousness that is ultimately hard to distinguish from vanity. “Motherless Brooklyn” devotes a lot of time to explanation, which may be necessary given the intricacy of the plot, but which turns into a lecture after a while. A fable of power dissipates in a fantasy of rescue. Lionel evolves a little too conveniently from misfit to paladin, from ally of the marginal and oppressed to their would-be savior. He’s a kind of noble answer to the Joker, another beleaguered city dweller who explains his strange behavior with reference to a neurological condition. The high-mindedness of the movie, its showy conviction that its heart is in the right place, dulls some of its political insights. And its grandiosity undermines the ragged pleasures of the genre. Norton seems to have decided that the best way to celebrate Lionel’s underdog scrappiness was to build a monument in its honor.  Motherless Brooklyn Rated R. Gunplay and wordplay. Running time: 2 hours 24 minutes."
191,The Irishman,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/movies/the-irishman-review.html,"One of the all-time canonical moments in the work of Martin Scorsese — and, therefore, in all of American cinema — is the two-and-a-half-minute sequence in “Goodfellas” sometimes known as “the Copa shot.” In a single, unbroken take, the camera, gliding and swiveling to absorb every detail along the way, follows Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta) and his sweetheart, Karen (Lorraine Bracco), from Henry’s car, through the kitchen and into the hurly-burly of the nightclub, accompanied by the sound of the Crystals singing “Then He Kissed Me.” For Henry, an up-and-coming mobster — and also for the viewer, hovering in the limbo between bystander and accomplice — the arrival at the Copa is a pure and potent dose of gangster glamour. Life is good. The opening shot of “The Irishman,” Scorsese’s latest long-form crime story (opening Friday in theaters around the country), evokes that earlier scene and turns it inside out. Once again, the camera floats down corridors and around corners accompanied by a radio hit from the past. This time it’s the tune “In the Still of the Night” by the Five Satins, and we’re in a nursing home. We make our way past doctors and orderlies, our attention finally coming to rest in a quiet, nearly empty room furnished with institutional tables and chairs. An old man is waiting for us. Like Henry Hill, he’s going to tell the tale of his unsavory associates and criminal doings — a meandering reminiscence that will touch on some notorious historical episodes, many of them involving murder. But the mood is different this time around, even if we recognize a few of the faces (more on those faces shortly). The anecdotes, some of which are funny, some horrifying, are edged with a bleak sense of absurdity and shadowed by the rapid onset of oblivion. Death is close at hand. The next three and a half hours will feel like a long, final breath in fading light. The light is managed by the cinematographer, Rodrigo Prieto. The passing of time is handled by the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker. The movie is long and dark: long like a novel by Dostoyevsky or Dreiser, dark like a painting by Rembrandt. The man, whose name is Frank Sheeran — he’s the Irishman we’ve come to see, and he’s played by Robert De Niro — has some information to share about something everyone used to care about, a piece of information that at one time could have gotten him and a lot of other people killed. Actually a lot of people did get killed. One of them might have been James Riddle Hoffa, better known as Jimmy, the former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Nowadays, Frank reckons, the name Jimmy Hoffa doesn’t mean much anymore. Back in the decades after World War II, though, when organized labor and organized crime were mighty forces in the land, the name stirred fear and admiration in the hearts of politicians, racketeers and ordinary working stiffs. “In the ’50s, he was like Elvis,” Frank says of the man who was his boss, friend and eventual quarry. “In the ’60s he was bigger than the Beatles.” In 1975, Hoffa vanished, and speculation about what happened to him was for many years the stuff of wild conspiracy theories and stand-up-comedy routines. Jack Nicholson played him in a 1992 biopic, written by David Mamet and directed by Danny DeVito. “The Irishman,” with a blustering, showboating, disarmingly tender Al Pacino in the Hoffa role, isn’t competing with that movie, or trying to correct the historical record. There was a real Frank Sheeran, who really did claim involvement in Hoffa’s demise, though not everyone believes him. Scorsese, working from Steve Zaillian’s adaptation of a book by Charles Brandt (called “I Heard You Paint Houses”), assembles a kind of gangland greatest hits. The pun is intended: this is a history of the United States in a few dozen killings. Some are obscure, like the whacking of a guy named Whispers (not to be confused with a different guy named Whispers) who stuck his beak in the wrong birdbath. Others still have a garish tabloid glow, like the shooting of “Crazy Joe” Gallo at Umberto’s Clam House in Manhattan. Add the assassination of John F. Kennedy to the list, along with Hoffa’s disappearance. But public affairs and Cosa Nostra chronicles aren’t really what this movie is about. Don’t get me wrong: there is plenty of grisly, crazy mob lore, blood and tomato sauce, guys with colorful nicknames, episodes that wander away from the main plot. Every so often the screen will freeze and a note will appear supplying the date and manner of a minor character’s eventual death. These aren’t facts for the final exam, but part of a deeper, sadder lesson that has to do with the inevitability of loss. The loss of life, yes, but also the erosion of meaning that accompanies the fading of experience into memory and memory into nothing. What interests Scorsese — what he has always cared most about — aren’t facts but feelings. Like many of his other films, “The Irishman” spends some time mapping the structures of power and the codes of behavior that govern its particular slice of reality. Frank, making his living as a truck driver in Pennsylvania after serving in World War II, becomes a soldier in the Philadelphia mob, working mostly for a local capo named Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci). Russell, whose cousin (Ray Romano) is a mob lawyer, connects Frank with Hoffa. Through flush times and lean, the Bay of Pigs and Watergate, the two bosses command Frank’s loyalty for the next 20 years or so. The business of graft, extortion and influence peddling occupies all these men, but “The Irishman” finds its emotional center in the vicissitudes of their friendship. This is Scorsese’s least sentimental picture of mob life, and for that reason his most poignant. Hoffa, for all his windy belligerence, is also petty to the point of neurosis. He can’t stand it when an upstart Teamster rival, Anthony Provenzano (Stephen Graham), shows up late for a meeting wearing shorts. Hoffa ruthlessly focuses on money and power, unless there’s the possibility of an ice cream sundae. I don’t mean that Pacino and Scorsese make Hoffa lovable, but rather that they render him at human scale. Russell and Frank, big shots in their own right, are small men too. In addition to checking in periodically on Frank in his lonely senescence, the movie repeatedly jumps back to a fateful road trip he and Russell took with their wives (Stephanie Kurtzuba and Kathrine Narducci), a journey as intoxicated with the banality of midcentury, middle-class married life as a John Updike story. And it’s in those quiet moments that the elegiac power of “The Irishman” really takes hold. The forward motion of time leads to only one destination, but movies can make it run backward too. Scorsese has digitally “de-aged” his principal actors, De Niro in particular, and while the effect takes some getting used to, it doesn’t take you out of the picture any more than makeup or prosthetics might. De Niro’s face looks a little blurry when Frank is supposed to be in his 40s and 50s, but what’s more striking is that the body it’s attached to seems to belong to the actor’s present-day, 76-year-old self. There is something beautiful and fitting about that incongruity, and also about the presence of so many actors we’ve seen in other Scorsese films. Harvey Keitel shows up, as does Welker White, who was Henry Hill’s babysitter in “Goodfellas” and is Jo Hoffa, Jimmy’s wife, here. Pesci, who has been mostly absent from movies for the past 20 years, is the revelation. He’s lost the strut and the shtick that used to define (and sometimes undermine) his performances, and does everything with his sad, watchful eyes and his lovely, walnut-shell face. When he and De Niro are onscreen together, you believe in the power of art. But “The Irishman” isn’t sentimental about that, either. It’s a gift for cinephiles, to be sure — it will arrive in theaters on Nov. 1, on Netflix Nov. 27 — but also a somber acknowledgment of limitations. Alongside the story of Frank’s career runs another one, nearly invisible to him, about the price paid by the women in his life, in particular his daughter Peggy. Peggy (played as a child by Lucy Gallina and then by Anna Paquin), is fond of Hoffa and creeped out by Russell. Though she barely says a word, her silence delivers a damning verdict on her father and his world. It also represents a gesture on Scorsese’s part toward some of the stories he hasn’t chosen or known how to tell over the years. That’s another kind of loss. To watch this movie, especially in its long, graceful final movement, is to feel a circle closing. This isn’t the last film Scorsese will make, or the last film anyone will make about the Mafia in its heyday, but it does arrive at a kind of resting place. Not an easy one, by any means, since what “The Irishman” looks back on is a legacy of violence and waste, of men too hard and mean to be mourned. A monument is a complicated thing. This one is big and solid — and also surprisingly, surpassingly delicate. The Irishman Rated R. Everybody dies. Running time: 3 hours 30 minutes."
192,Harriet,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/movies/harriet-review.html,"When I first started out as a film critic, I used to get regular mail — actual written letters, in envelopes — from a reader who wanted to know why Hollywood hadn’t made an action movie about Harriet Tubman. I didn’t have a good answer (other than the obvious answer), but the question was a good one. Tubman’s remarkable biography has all the right elements: danger, surprise and the kind of against-all-odds heroism that brings people to the movies. “Harriet,” directed by Kasi Lemmons (“Eve’s Bayou,” “Black Nativity”) and anchored by Cynthia Erivo’s precise and passionate performance in the title role, might not be exactly what my correspondent had in mind, but it is a rousing and powerful drama, respectful of both the historical record and the cravings of modern audiences. The story of Tubman’s escape from enslavement on a Maryland farm and her subsequent leadership in the underground railroad is conveyed in bold, emphatic strokes. Villainy and virtue are clearly marked, and the evil that Tubman resisted is illuminated alongside her bravery. Before she chose Harriet as her “freedom name,” and before she became the mysterious liberator known to slaves and their masters as Moses, Tubman is called Minty Ross (short for Araminta). Like her mother and siblings, she is the property of the Brodess family, though both her father, Ben Ross (Clarke Peters) and her husband, John Tubman (Zackary Momoh), are free.  One of Lemmons’s achievements is to show that their freedom, rather than mitigating the horrors of chattel slavery, emphasizes its cruelty and also its moral dishonesty. It is more than Minty can bear, and so, with the encouragement of her father and the help of a free black minister (Vondie Curtis-Hall), she runs. Reaching Philadelphia, she is welcomed by William Still (Leslie Odom Jr.) and taken in by Marie Buchanon (Janelle Monáe), antislavery activists whose ease and urbanity astonish her. “Harriet” pays tribute to their efforts while noting the tactical and temperamental differences between its heroine and her allies, many of whom had been born and raised in freedom. She is both part of a movement and something of a maverick within it, taking her instructions directly from God and setting out on missions that her colleagues often regard as irresponsibly risky. These missions take her back into the land of her former owners, whose decadence and corruption are represented by Eliza, the Brodess matriarch (Jennifer Nettles), and her nasty son Gideon (Joe Alwyn). Harriet is determined to liberate the members of her family, which means evading both white slave-catchers and an especially fearsome black bounty hunter named Bigger Long (Omar J. Dorsey). The chases are suspenseful, and the violence is fairly restrained. The pain of enslavement is written on Erivo’s face and on the scarred bodies of the people Harriet brings out of bondage, but the full brutality of the masters and their minions is more implied than shown.  “Harriet” isn’t an immersion in horror like Steve McQueen’s “Twelve Years a Slave,” and it doesn’t have the imaginative sweep and complexity of literary depictions of slavery like Edward P. Jones’s “The Known World,” Colson Whitehead’s “Underground Railroad” or Toni Morrison’s “Beloved.” It is more like one of those biographies of historical figures intended for young readers: accessible, emotionally direct and artfully simplified. The exception — the aspect of the film that suggests some of the strangeness and intricacies of a reality that is both unimaginably distant and not even past — is Erivo herself. Perhaps as a result of an injury inflicted by her enslavers when she was a child, Harriet is subject to religious visions, “fits” that impart the gift of prophecy. (Joan of Arc’s name is invoked, in addition to Moses’s.) This is a kind of super power, but Erivo’s performance is grounded in the recognizable human emotions of grief, jealousy, anger and love. There is also a formidable intelligence at work, both tactical and political, and an elusive, almost mysterious quality as well. This is someone you want to know more about. Harriet Rated PG-13. Cruelty and valor. Running time: 2 hours 5 minutes."
195,Marriage Story,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/movies/marriage-story-review.html,"Traditionally, a story that ends in matrimony is classified as a comedy. But what about a story that begins with the end of a marriage? Noah Baumbach’s tender and stinging new film, “Marriage Story,” doesn’t quite answer the question. It’s funny and sad, sometimes within a single scene, and it weaves a plot out of the messy collapse of a shared reality, trying to make music out of disharmony. The melody is full of heartbreak, loss and regret, but the song is too beautiful to be entirely melancholy. Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) are an artistic couple living in Brooklyn with their 8-year-old son, Henry (the wonderful, deadpan Azhy Robertson). Both parents work in the theater: Nicole, a former teenage movie star (and a child of Hollywood), is a leading performer in the experimental stage company that Charlie, himself a sometime actor, directs. What we know of their life together is conveyed in an opening montage in which each partner, in turn, lists the things they love about the other. They’ve compiled these catalogs at the urging of the mediator hired to help them through their separation. What follows — as an amicable split becomes a shattering rupture, lurching from awkwardness to rage in search of a new equilibrium — is a reversal of Tolstoy’s sturdy observation about happy and unhappy families. Happiness is unique, inexpressible, a state that exists outside of narrative. Misery is what makes you just like everyone else. This is certainly the perspective of the divorce lawyers who soon replace that hapless mediator. Nicole, who has a role on a television pilot, takes Henry to Los Angeles, where her sister (Merritt Wever), their mother (Julie Hagerty) and Henry’s cousins live. This move, which Charlie insists is temporary — “we’re a New York family,” he says to anyone who will listen — becomes a point of contention between the spouses and their attorneys. Papers are served. Voices are raised. Henry, whose well-being is supposedly everyone’s chief concern, is pulled back and forth, his life wrenched out of sync. Nicole and Charlie, onetime creative collaborators, become characters in a drama neither one controls. “We need to tell your story,” says Nora (Laura Dern), Nicole’s lawyer. Charlie visits two — a rumpled mensch (Alan Alda) and a shark in a suit (Ray Liotta) — and one of them urges him to “change the narrative.” For both parties (as they are called once their experiences are translated into legalese), this means rewriting a happy-couple past into a history of struggle. The most painful parts of “Marriage Story” act out that revisionism, as idiosyncrasies are made to look pathological and mistakes are treated as potential crimes. The German social critic Theodor W. Adorno wrote that “divorce, even between good-natured, amiable, educated people, is apt to stir up a dust-cloud that covers and discolors all it touches,” an insight that Baumbach illustrates with vivid precision. He shows how “the sphere of intimacy” (to continue with Adorno) “is transformed into a malignant poison as soon as the relationship in which it flourished is broken off.” The intimacy doesn’t just vanish. At their moment of most intense conflict — when the thin line between love and hate seems to have been irrevocably crossed — Nicole still calls Charlie “honey.” There is still a residue of sweetness between them, which offers hope, not necessarily for reconciliation but for a limit to the damage each will inflict and sustain. What is happening is catastrophic, ridiculous and also — as the lawyers know — perfectly ordinary. Baumbach, exploiting and extending the tremendous talents of his cast, refuses to exaggerate. There are spasms of farce and throbs of melodrama, but they arise within the rhythms of everyday behavior. Which is not to say that Nicole and Charlie are confined to the shabby, somber stagecraft that so often passes for realism. They are large, complicated personalities with professional and emotional lives that fill their days, and the screen, with anxiety, surprise and occasional delight. Baumbach works to be fair to both of them, and the effort shows. Like his other movies, perhaps even more so, this one feels personal. I don’t just mean autobiographical. In a few minutes on Google you can find out about his marriage, his parents, his in-laws and whatever else you want to know. That information only confirms what you have already intuited if you’ve seen “The Squid and the Whale,” “Margot at the Wedding,” “While We’re Young” or “The Meyerowitz Stories: New and Selected”: He draws from his own life. But you shouldn’t expect the picture to be perfectly objective or symmetrical. In some ways, “Marriage Story” is harder on Charlie than on Nicole, underlining his self-absorbed, self-pitying tendencies, but he also occupies the film’s sympathetic center of gravity. It understands him better, even as Nicole has plenty of chances to explain herself. She seems to be the one who precipitated the breakup, whose expectations and feelings changed in ways that Charlie struggles to comprehend. He is blind to some of the consequences of his own behavior, which includes cheating on Nicole with a member of the theater company. The infidelity is treated as a sidebar, which isn’t entirely convincing. And while “Marriage Story” delves into the tangled thickets of its characters’ feelings, it is coy — or maybe just tactful — about their sexual lives, together and apart. Nicole has a moment of lust (following a moment of fury), but Charlie is, libidinally speaking, a closed book. The complexity of the film’s perspective — what Baumbach reveals and what he withholds, how he keeps up with characters whose circumstances are changing rapidly even as they feel like they’re stuck — places enormous demands on Driver and Johansson, who are simply extraordinary. They are perfectly matched, which is to say interestingly mismatched, given the trajectory of the story. Each one has a charisma that’s a little mysterious, a hint of Cubism in their faces, an undertone of irony in their voices. How could they ever have expected to know each other? One of the morals of this story, chastening but also oddly encouraging, is that we don’t ever really know one another, but we’re nonetheless obligated to try. Lawyers do it their way, insisting on simple answers to difficult questions. This is the place to note that Alda, Liotta and Dern collectively come close to stealing the movie, in part because they are playing performers fully in their element in ways that Charlie and Nicole are not. We sometimes see those two at work — there are some delicious tidbits of backstage comedy, in both New York and Los Angeles — but rarely onstage. There are two important exceptions, moments of theater that use borrowed words and self-conscious artifice to deliver strong doses of unadorned feeling. Both involve songs from Stephen Sondheim’s “Company”: “You Could Drive a Person Crazy,” a jaunty complaint about falling for a charming narcissist; and “Being Alive,” a heartfelt lament about being one. That number, sung by Driver near the end of “Marriage Story,” is an anthem of need, building to the shattering realization that “alone is alone, not alive.” That is a bleak conclusion, and it’s one that this meticulous and messy movie both acknowledges and resists. Bouncing between two large, opinionated American cities, Charlie and Nicole discover that other people are impossible and indispensable: children, colleagues, in-laws, exes, even sworn officers of the matrimonial bar. Alive is alive, not alone. Marriage Story Rated R. Sometimes mommies and daddies have feelings. Running time: 2 hours 16 minutes."
196,Doctor Sleep,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/movies/doctor-sleep-review.html,"“Doctor Sleep,” Mike Flanagan’s adaptation of the novel by Stephen King, catches up with Danny Torrance, who as a child was terrorized by demons and his own father at a spooky Rocky Mountain hotel. That was in “The Shining,” published by King in 1977 and filmed by Stanley Kubrick in a movie released in 1980. The new film, depending on how you look at it, is a sequel, an update, a corrective or a disaster. King was never a fan of Kubrick’s cold, meticulous gothic, which has nonetheless gathered a sturdy cult following. Flanagan, while hewing more closely to the novelist’s ideas about evil, innocence and addiction, pays tribute to some of Kubrick’s visual signatures, especially in flashbacks that take grown-up Dan (as he’s called now) back to the Overlook. He remembers a dad (Henry Thomas) with darting Jack Nicholson eyebrows and a mother (Alex Essoe) with Shelley Duvall saucer eyes. Dan, played by a subdued Ewan McGregor, has had a hard time of it. After his mother’s death, he spirals into alcoholism, eventually finding solace and sobriety in a small New Hampshire town. He also finds a job, as an orderly in a home for the elderly, and a friend, named Billy (Cliff Curtis). The ghouls who used to haunt him have been put away, thanks to a mental trick he learns from the ghost of his old pal Dick Hallorann (Carl Lumbly, in the role played by Scatman Crothers in “The Shining.”) Meanwhile — well, there’s a whole lot of meanwhile. In print, “Doctor Sleep” runs to 531 pages, which is fairly compact by King’s recent standards. This screen adaptation feels like a clumsy hybrid. It’s a little too long and winding to work as a feature film, especially in the horror genre, and might have worked better as a limited series, with a little more room for the many characters who populate its grimly imagined American landscape. Its slow pacing and diffuse suspense make the experience more like a book on tape than anything else, in spite of a few lively performances. Dan joins forces with a young girl named Abra (Kyliegh Curran, making an impressive film debut), who lives in another part of New Hampshire and who has gifts similar to his. Though if his extrasensory abilities shine, hers blaze like stadium lights. Her powers attract the attention of a predatory cabal known as the Knot, who travel the country in a caravan looking for psychically talented children to torture and kill. Their leader is Rose (Rebecca Ferguson), a blue-eyed seductress in a Babadook hat. The Knot feeds on steam, which is the soul energy (or something) that escapes from shiners in their death throes. Sometimes, as in the case of a sullen teenager (Emily Alyn Lind), the Knot recruits youngsters instead of devouring them. It’s not clear what they plan to do with Abra, but she and Dan fight back using wild mental tricks which Flanagan conveys by means of mostly pedestrian, occasionally surprising special effects. “Doctor Sleep” is a not a Stephen-King-scares-the-pants-off-you kind of movie. It’s a Stephen-King-invites-you-to-ponder-the-nature-of-evil kind of movie. (“It” managed to be both; “It Chapter Two” failed to be either.) There are some bad sections — the gratuitously sadistic rendering of a Knot victim’s fate — and some not-bad ones. Nothing that will keep you awake at night, but you probably won’t fall asleep in the middle either. Doctor Sleep Rated R. Ambient evil. Running time: 2 hours 31 minutes."
197,Last Christmas,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/movies/last-christmas-review.html,"“Boy Meets Girl, So What?” That’s the title of a movie that Bertolt Brecht thought up when he was exiled in Hollywood in the 1940s. It’s also an evergreen question, one that I crankily mutter whenever I watch another romantic comedy that tries to reanimate a subgenre that’s fallen on hard times, largely because the old orthodoxies about human beings and love — and what constitutes happily ever after — no longer apply. It was apparently so much easier for filmmakers when female happiness meant men, marriage and babymaking. That helps explain “Last Christmas,” a romantic comedy directed by Paul Feig that presents itself as a classic love story — boy meets girl — while busily rearranging its crucial bits. It does this with a big twist embedded in a lot of cutesy chatter, truckloads of plot, many feelings and even more life lessons. The twist is clever enough, though much depends on whether you see it coming. Whether you do or not (I didn’t), it is a steep price to pay for a movie that advocates tolerance, community and other virtues yet views its audience members as barbarians in need of regular schooling. That’s a drag because there’s some talent here, beginning with Emma Thompson, who has a showboating supporting role and shares script credit with Bryony Kimmings. Thompson is probably responsible for some of the snappier lines (that’s a reassuring fantasy, at least) and perhaps the sermonizing, too. But it’s hard to know who to blame for the forced and discordant scenes, or the mood-killing casting of Emilia Clarke and Henry Golding as the romantic leads. The actors look good together — never more so than on the movie’s poster — but her character’s strenuous perkiness and his character’s damp sincerity cancel each other out. Clarke plays Kate, a singer and aspiring musical performer living and scarcely struggling in London. She has a silly job in a Christmas shop where, dressed as an elf, she spars with the owner, a woman who calls herself Santa and is played by an agreeably astringent Michelle Yeoh. Clarke sparks off Yeoh (and Thompson) but they, alas, are not the romantic pair. Eventually Kate meets her designated one, Tom (Golding), a bland smiler who swoops in on a bicycle instead of a white horse and, despite a regular disappearing act, more or less serves a familiar princely function. Feig is an adroit director of comedy and he gives “Last Christmas” some fizz now and again. But he’s stymied by the romance and the gimmick, and the pairing of Clarke and Golding proves an impossible hurdle, making even the seemingly simplest moments — an intimate walk, a heartfelt talk — feel badly labored. After a while, particularly when Tom floats off, you start to wonder why the filmmakers even bothered with a romance, when all the best stuff, including at a homeless shelter, happens without Tom. Surely Kate, who seems to have so little going for her, except of course that she’s lovely, loved, talented and alive, could have learned all her lessons without such a dreary prop. Last Christmas Rated PG-13 for something, though it’s unclear what. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes."
198,Playing with Fire,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/movies/playing-with-fire-review.html,"The hero of “Playing With Fire,” Jake Carson (John Cena), is forever pointing out that he’s not a firefighter. He’s a smokejumper, and with the help of his quirky crew, played by John Leguizamo and Keegan-Michael Key, Jake drops from helicopters to put out forest fires. With single-minded focus, he seeks out the most dangerous blazes. Unfortunately, the flat-footed family comedy around him fails to produce sparks. Jake’s hyper-regimentation is challenged when his crew lowers him into a burning cabin. He finds three children huddled in the blaze and takes them into his care at the station. Immediately, the kids, ranging in age from toddler to teenager, make themselves too much at home. Most of the movie’s comedy comes from the chaos of children run amok in fireman’s land. They shoot nail guns and play in the fire simulation room, and their ragamuffin charms quickly win over the grown-ups. Jake warms, abandoning regulation in favor of fun at home and even romance with the scientist gal next door. But despite the novel setting, the director Andy Fickman has made a visually flat film. The editing is frequently awkward, clunkily overemphasizing physical gags, and lingering too long on the actors as they try to light up dusty material. What “Playing With Fire” does get right is its central casting. Cena suits his woodblock character, imbuing the square firestopper with a warmth that seems neither phony nor self-conscious, and the always welcome Judy Greer waves her magic character-actress wand to fill out what might have been a scolding love interest. It’s an unchallenging movie, but as far as unchallenging kids movies go, the actors ensure this one doesn’t fall into soullessness. Playing With Fire Rated PG for action scenes and gross out humor. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes."
199,Midway,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/movies/midway-review.html,"To say that “Midway,” a new cinematic re-creation of the decisive 1942 air and sea battle from Roland Emmerich, the director of “Independence Day,” soars to the heights of his best work is to say it sputters along at sea level. It is rousing and respectful in its best moments and faintly ridiculous in others. The film belongs to a particular lineage of World War II picture (“Tora! Tora! Tora!” and the 1976 “Midway”) that — unlike, say, Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk” — prioritizes scope over individual drama. To cram all the complexities of geography and who was where when into less than two and a half hours, “Midway” resorts to having its characters converse in exposition, sacrificing one form of verisimilitude for another.  “We get 80 percent of our oil from your country,” the Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto (Etsushi Toyokawa) informs Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson), an American naval intelligence officer, when they meet in a prologue set in 1937. The audience needs that clunkily relayed context for Pearl Harbor, the first combat spectacle that Emmerich stages. Later on, Layton must convince Adm. Chester W. Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) that a code-breaker has reliable reconnaissance that the Japanese are planning to attack Midway, an American-controlled Pacific outpost.   The film’s most exciting sequences put you in the seat of Dick Best (Ed Skrein), a naval pilot known for taking chances, as he risks his life repeatedly, dive-bombing airstrips on carriers to handicap Japan’s fighting ability. With point-of-view shots and sound that comes at you from all directions, Emmerich conjures an immersive sense of hurtling toward almost-certain death while under heavy fire. “Men like Dick Best are the reason we’re going to win this war,” says Wade McClusky (Luke Evans), a fellow pilot. While code-breaking did give Americans the jump on the Japanese arrival at Midway, the people in the film talk with such portent that the movie almost gives the impression that they can see all the way to 1945. The British-born Skrein’s stab at a New Jersey accent seems almost as reckless as his character’s actions in the air, although Dennis Quaid gives him some competition in the mumbling department.  The Japanese get a decent share of screen time but a much less generous portrayal, in which they tend to speak in premonitions of their own defeat. (“Brave men,” one says of the Americans. “We are fortunate they have such bad planes.”) Seen briefly, the great John Ford (Geoffrey Blake) — who in the 1942 short “The Battle of Midway” documented the fighting at such close range that you can detect the film shaking in the camera from the explosions — is relegated to mere comic relief in this movie. “Keep shooting, keep shooting,” he orders the cameraman after he’s knocked off his feet. Now Ford is a director who could find the poetry in history. Midway Rated PG-13 for gruesome battle footage. Running time: 2 hours 18 minutes."
200,Klaus,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/movies/klaus-review.html,"Jason Schwartzman does almost too good of a job voicing an irritating character in the animated movie “Klaus.” He plays Jesper, a student who is deliberately flunking out of the postal academy. He believes that his father, the academy’s head who’s been indulging the kid’s cushy lifestyle, will hand him a cushy position with an “as you were.” Not so. Instead, Jesper is given a mission: to revivify the post office of Smeerensburg, an island above the Arctic Circle. Through his dressing-down and into his journey north, Jesper complains in terms associated with stereotypes of entitled Gen Z-ers, with a whiny pitch and lots of anachronistic vocabulary. “Can we talk about it, man?” is his most emphatic bit of resistance to the proposed exile. Thank goodness there are things worth watching over Jesper’s puling. “Klaus” is the first feature directed by Sergio Pablos, a Disney veteran who created the story for “Despicable Me” and founded his own animation studio. The dominant influence here is not just Disney but vintage Disney. The backgrounds and character design at the postal academy bring to mind the 1959 version of “Sleeping Beauty.” Smeerensburg is an intimidating and sometimes terrifying place at first; suffused with gray on Jesper’s arrival, alive with grotesque shadows and sickly green in one of its fish shops, and still bleak in the next day’s ostensibly cheery yellow sunshine. The inventive use of color evokes the work of Mary Blair, the Disney studio’s secret tint weapon from the 1940s to the ’60s. Jesper gets a bit less insufferable as he plumbs the place’s mysteries. There’s a persistent feud between two clans. The disillusioned schoolmaster Alva (Rashida Jones), who turned fishmonger to pay for an escape route, could be motivated to pursue her calling after all. And deep in the forest there’s a woodsman named Klaus (J.K. Simmons), a surly giant with a workshop full of new toys. His tender heart lies just beneath a surface grumpiness that’s as thin as the material on a lottery scratch-off card. So it’s relatively easy for Jesper to convince the fellow to give him the toys to deliver, postage paid, to the kids of the island. From there, “Klaus” concocts original ways to tick off practically all the boxes of a Santa origin story: How the means of transport became a sled. How reindeer got involved. Why the sled flies. How the chimney came to be used. It all moves along so amiably, and offers such consistently delightful visuals, that the conventional plot points, up to and including an inevitable “but I can explain” bit, are entirely digestible. These clichés inhibit “Klaus” from achieving instant-classic status, but the film is winning enough that it’s worth a place in a family Christmas-movie library (not that, as a Netflix offering, it will take up any physical space). Klaus Rated PG. Running time: 1 hour 37 minutes."
201,Honey Boy,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/movies/honey-boy-review.html,"For years, the talented actor Shia LaBeouf, who started in film and television as a child, has been acting out his emotional disturbances and drug and alcohol issues in public. In the wake of a 2017 arrest during which he made racist remarks, he has been taking more sober stock of his life and art. He wrote the screenplay and plays a major role in “Honey Boy,” directed by Alma Har’el in her fiction feature debut. Even viewers who know nothing of LaBeouf and his back story might detect this film’s autobiographical key. “Honey Boy” has two openings. One features Noah Jupe as the fresh-faced child actor Otis, a precocious talent, in the dubious care of his alcoholic, bitter father, James. The other features the adult Otis, played by Lucas Hedges, an overly attitudinal star of effects-driven blockbuster movies whose offscreen life is like a drunken hellion montage. The movie toggles between the ’90s and the ’00s, child Otis and man-child Otis. It highlights hair-raising interactions between Otis and James, played by LaBeouf. His drawling evocation of his own father is a bravura incarnation of resentment.  On the surface James appears a manipulator of genius, but for all his machinations he is constantly flopping in the arenas of power, money and sex. The movie makes a point of showing him striking out with a beautiful young woman (the music and dance artist FKA twigs, whose casting indicates the hipness quotient to which the movie aspires); young Otis then picks up Dad’s slack and starts an intimate friendship with her. Harsh! One could watch “Honey Boy” musing that it must be nice to have someone finance a movie of your 12-step qualification. That assessment is actually too generous. To share one’s “experience, strength and hope,” as Alcoholics Anonymous puts it, is meant, ostensibly, to help others. This is not the aim here. “Honey Boy” is a flex: an assertion of the clout LaBeouf claims, in interviews, to no longer have. When adult Otis sasses his counselor (Martin Starr) at a recovery facility, so high end it has a grand piano in its reception area, Hedges and Ha’rel don’t present the character as a damaged person having a difficult time accepting help. Rather, they concoct a rough and tough, rehab-resistant maverick who can’t be tamed because his wounds are just too complicated. Near the film’s end, Otis splits from rehab and finds James back at the motel. Sitting by the pool, they share a joint. “I’m gonna make a movie about you, Dad,” Otis says. And there you have it. Honey Boy Rated R for themes, language, drunken hellion montages. Running time: 1 hour 34 minutes."
202,Ford v Ferrari,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/movies/ford-v-ferrari-review.html,"Quick: Who won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966? If you know the answer without Googling, then I probably don’t have to sell you on “Ford v Ferrari,” James Mangold’s nimble and crafty reconstruction of a storied moment in the annals of auto racing. You will probably go in prepared to spot torque differentials and historical discrepancies that escaped my notice. (Please let me know what you find.) If, on the other hand, you are (like me) a bit of a motor-sport ignoramus, then you might want to stay away from web-search spoilers and let the film surprise you. It is, all in all, a pleasant surprise. Partly because Christian Bale and Matt Damon, the lead actors, are really good, and are supported by a fine cast that includes Tracy Letts in one of the best and least-expected crying scenes of the year. And partly because the car stuff — in the garage and on the track — is crisply filmed and edited, offering a reminder that movies and automobiles have a natural affinity and a lot of shared history. From the Keystone Kops days to “The Fast and the Furious,” some of the best motion in motion pictures has come from gasoline-powered vehicles. But “Ford v Ferrari,” written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, pushes the connection further, suggesting subtle but unmistakable links between racing and filmmaking as aesthetic and economic propositions. Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles, the car designer and driver played by Damon and Bale, are risk-hungry free spirits gambling with someone else’s money, unruly individualists who nonetheless depend on the good will of a large corporation. The conflict alluded to in the title — between the assembly lines of Detroit and the artisanal workshops of Modena, Italy, for supremacy in the racing world — is a bit of a red herring. The real struggle is between the managers and bureaucrats of the Ford Motor Company and the mavericks whose work rolls out onto the track bearing the Ford logo. It’s not much of a stretch to imagine Carroll and Ken as filmmakers fighting with studio suits for creative control. They are, in any case, cool guys of a particular vintage, avatars of a salty, clean-cut, old-style masculinity that is enjoying a somewhat improbable vogue these days. Their effort to build a Le Mans-winning racecar for Ford is an engineering challenge similar in ambition to the Apollo program commemorated in Damien Chazelle’s “First Man,” though smaller in scale. The chalk-and-cheese friendship between Carroll, a solid, unflappable Texan, and Ken, a spidery, easily flapped Englishman, might remind you of the bond between Brad Pitt’s and Leonardo DiCaprio’s characters in “Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood.” Like those movies, this one embraces a view of the ’60s in which the square American mainstream is where the action is. Well, not every kind of action. If “Ford v Ferrari,” with its loose-limbed narrative rhythm and its love of grease and noise, had been made a few years after the events it depicts, it might have starred someone like Steve McQueen, Robert Redford or even Burt Reynolds — actors who infused whatever else they were doing onscreen with a frank, sometimes aggressive sexuality. Damon and Bale, both charismatic movie stars, don’t put out quite the same kind of erotic magnetism, and their characters are decidedly not tomcats or horndogs. Ken is the picture of uxoriousness, devoted to his sighing, supportive wife, Mollie (Caitriona Balfe), and their son, Peter (Noah Jupe), who idolizes his dad. Carroll, as far as we know, has no personal life at all. I’m not complaining, just taking note of a shift in mores. Onscreen and maybe off, ambition has taken the place of lust. Work is the new sex. And work — its pleasures and frustrations, the interference of bosses and the camaraderie of colleagues — is what propels “Ford v Ferrari.” Carroll, a former Le Mans champion who gave up competitive driving for health reasons, knows Ken, who runs a struggling repair shop in Los Angeles, from the American racing circuit. The two of them take up a commission bestowed by Henry Ford II (the wonderful Letts). His family business is threatened by the doughtiness of its products, which restless young baby boomers don’t want to buy. Beating Ferrari at Le Mans will be part of a rebranding strategy that also includes the introduction of the sporty Mustang. The Italians are foils — old-world artisans and Machiavellian schemers whose ethos is embodied by the company patriarch, Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone). Carroll and Ken don’t have much to do with their rivals before the race itself, tangling instead with Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), a frustrated semi-visionary in the ranks of the Ford executives, and Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas), who is given control of the company’s racing program. Beebe, with his side-parted hair, his boxy suits and his unctuous grin, is the designated villain, with a special animus against Ken, who is evidently “not a Ford man.” Carroll is caught in the middle, since he is technically Ken’s boss and the person Ford has, somewhat reluctantly, decided to trust. The boardroom intrigue enlivens the raceway drama, and vice versa. “Ford v Ferrari” is no masterpiece, but it is — to invoke a currently simmering debate — real cinema, the kind of solid, satisfying, nonpandering movie that can seem endangered nowadays. (I should note that Mangold’s résumé includes “Logan” and “The Wolverine,” two of the more interesting superhero movies of the last decade.) To put it in the simplest terms: You may not think you care who won at Le Mans in 1966, but for two and a half hours, you will. Ford v Ferrari Rated PG-13. Strong language and fast driving. Running time: 2 hours 32 minutes."
204,The Good Liar,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/movies/the-good-liar-review.html,"“The Good Liar” requires something stricter than a standard spoiler warning. To avoid ruining the film, you should not only stop reading this review, but also pass on seeing the movie, which tips its hand practically from the moment the main characters meet. They meet — on a dating website, anyway — during the opening credits. As the film crosscuts between their online interactions, we see that they are already both liars, albeit in a mild sense. Roy (Ian McKellen) indicates that he is a nonsmoker even as he puffs on a cigarette at his keyboard. Betty (Helen Mirren) passes herself off as a nondrinker as she sips from a glass of wine. But when they get together in person, they hit it off quickly, with Betty charmed by Roy’s humor and turns of phrase. The film, adapted from Nicholas Searle’s 2016 novel of the same title, is structurally lopsided. When not following the couple’s courtship, the movie stays with Roy, who is revealed to be not a charming and frail widower but a coldblooded con man with multiple schemes going at once. (Apart from the romance, he is involved in a plan to bilk shady investors of tens of thousands of pounds.) And he is dangerous: After telling Betty, for instance, that he will meet her for tea at Fortnum & Mason, he absconds to a tube station to commit a murder. It is always fun to watch the creases in McKellen’s face as the gears turn in Roy’s head, and the actor appears to get a kick out of switching on a dime between fragile Roy and menacing Roy. But during her offscreen time, Betty is — what? Could a retired Oxford professor really be dumb enough to fall for the idea that she and Roy, who have by this point started living together but are still platonic companions, open a joint account? Why would Mirren, no one’s notion of a damsel in distress, take a role that allows her to be little more than a helpless victim? Asking such questions is the wrong way to approach this movie, which involves several layers of misdirection. Unfortunately, the director, Bill Condon, whose first film with McKellen was the much more interesting “Gods and Monsters” in 1998, is not an Alfred Hitchcock or a Brian De Palma — a filmmaker with a visual style seductive enough to offer distraction from the grinding plot mechanics, which are especially clunky here. The sleight of hand “The Good Liar” tries to pull off might be easier to keep hidden on the page. As it progresses, the film reveals complications (it plays particularly dubious tricks with the way it parcels out flashbacks to the 1940s) and a motive that might as well have been picked out of a hat. The finale could be written with entirely different details, and almost no scene preceding it would have to change. The real good liar is whoever convinced Mirren and McKellen to class up such thin and arbitrary material. The Good Liar Rated R. Pervasive prevarication. Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes."
205,The Report,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/movies/the-report-review.html,"The very title of “The Report” lays out the movie’s most daunting challenge: How do you engage, never mind excite, an audience with sheafs of classified documents, vaultlike work spaces and reams of expository dialogue — chunks of it delivered by impassive men in identical gray suits? Well, you could start by giving Adam Driver the starring role, hiring Jon Hamm to lope in and out of otherwise stagnant scenes, and threading shocking flashbacks through the more arid patches. The writer and director, Scott Z. Burns, does all of those things. Yet his smart, layered screenplay — depicting the U.S. Senate’s yearslong investigation into the C.I.A.’s endorsement of torture in the aftermath of Sept. 11 — adamantly resists liftoff. Saturated with details and counterterrorism jargon, crammed full of real-world characters some would prefer to forget (looking at you, John Yoo), this swampy exposé is so tangled in red tape and competing political agendas that it can barely breathe. Striding through the fog of obfuscation is Daniel J. Jones (Driver), a staffer charged by Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening) with investigating the C.I.A.’s euphemistically named enhanced interrogation techniques. As Jones and his small team learn about these methods, and the psychologists — the movie’s de facto villains — who designed them, stomach-churning flashbacks of abused Al Qaeda detainees hammer home their brutality and the myth of their effectiveness. These backward leaps act like cattle prods, jarring us out of the somnolence that densely talkative films can induce. We need them: However crucial and opportune in its truth-seeking and depictions of political trickery (Burns could hardly have known his film would plop into theaters alongside the impeachment hearings for President Trump), “The Report” is too often dramatically frozen, its emotions stubbornly internal. Given the near-impossible task of gluing our eyes to blank rooms and cautious conversations, the cinematographer, Eigil Bryld, mostly zooms in close and crosses his fingers. So starved are we for sensation that when a summary of Jones’s findings is finally exposed to the light of an official hearing, the triumphal surge nearly caused me to yelp with relief. Aside from the occasional spicy performance (like Hamm’s smooth turn as Denis McDonough, Barack Obama’s chief of staff, and Ted Levine’s slyly damning portrayal of the former C.I.A. Director John Brennan), it’s Driver who must bear the film’s considerable weight. He does so by giving Jones a mounting fury that manifests not in explosive confrontations, but in a gradually hardening resolve to protect and disseminate his findings. With Driver, there’s always a sense of something leashed, and his characters can seem to be operating on a plane above and beyond everyone else. These qualities align perfectly with Jones’s increasingly isolated and dangerous journey, yet the man beneath the mission remains frustratingly unknowable. In his vibrant screenplays for Steven Soderbergh (like “Contagion” in 2011 and this year’s “The Laundromat”), Burns has shown he’s more than capable of zapping complicated stories to life. And where “The Report” succeeds, it’s in pointing constantly and anxiously to the importance of holding government to account. Burns has clearly thought long and hard about how to open our eyes, but maybe not enough about how to keep them that way. The Report Rated R for nauseating abuse and disgusting cover-ups. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes."
206,Waves,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/movies/waves-review.html,"The camera doesn’t just move in “Waves,” it hurtles with terrific urgency. As you’re swept up in the immersive motion, the kinetic energy, you notice the passing beauty of the images, their compositional elegance. Mostly, though, you just try to keep up as voices boom and the camera pushes in, pulls out, flows in circles or sprints forward. This great whoosh creates a contact high even if, as one shot rapidly gives way to another, it feels as if time is running out. A domestic melodrama in an anguished key, “Waves” is the story of a Florida family nearly undone by a shocking tragedy. It’s also a spectacular testament to the talents of the writer-director Trey Edward Shults, making just his third feature-length movie. As in his estimable debut, “Krisha” (2016), about a woman having an epic meltdown at a family Thanksgiving, Shults has created a deep, at times overwhelming sensory experience. With sinuous cinematography and an intricate sound design — floods of saturated color, bursts of ear-pounding music — he expresses intensities of feeling (love, pain, fury, agony) that create a visceral emotional impact. The story in “Waves” is tragic, blunt; it turns on a catastrophic mistake and its devastating aftermath. Bookended by the image of a girl riding a bike alone, it unfolds in two neatly complementary sections. The first pivots on Tyler (Kelvin Harrison Jr.), a black 17-year-old student and wrestler struggling to keep the fast-moving parts of his life in balance. He’s an appealing kid, no longer a child yet not quite a man. By turns industrious and restless, dutiful and disobedient, he is also graced with sensitivities that his carefully constructed wall of muscles can’t obscure. In the first half, Shults keeps close to Tyler, creating a palpable intimacy — the director of photography is Drew Daniels — that locks you in with the character, his upper-middle-class home and larger world. Tyler is often on the move and you’re right there with him, whether he’s driving with his girlfriend (Alexa Demie), lifting weights with his stern father, Ronald (Sterling K. Brown), or sharing a private moment with his sympathetic stepmother (Renée Elise Goldsberry). Harrison movingly exteriorizes Tyler’s mercurial emotions, shifting between adolescent bravura and childlike woundedness, and later tapping into the sorrow and rage that engulf him. At this stage in his young career, Shults is a stronger image-maker than writer and, like many American filmmakers, he has a tendency to overexplain, including in some parent-child talks. As a black man in the United States, Ronald has been pushed, and he pushes Tyler, who, in turn, pushes himself until he breaks. Shults, who is white, deftly negotiates the heaviness of race, even if a speech that Ronald delivers to Tyler about the burdens of being black in the United States sounds as if it might have been written for the benefit of white viewers. An intensely empathetic performer, Brown fills these words up with feeling, but it’s hard not to think this father taught his children this lesson long ago. When the tragedy finally comes it is cataclysmic, and unutterably sad. Soon thereafter, the focus shifts to Tyler’s younger sister, Emily (Taylor Russell, an open-faced heartbreaker). Unlike her brother, Emily is quiet and physically contained, almost shut down, and Shults adjusts his filmmaking accordingly. By that point, the freneticism that accompanied Tyler’s introduction has already given way to slower camera movements and cuts. But now, in the aftermath of the family’s trauma and with the focus on Emily, everything looks — feels — smoother, stiller, more pacific, creating a sense of quietude that is a relief but that also underscores her anguished isolation. Like Barry Jenkins, the Safdie brothers and Robert Eggers, Shults belongs to a group of young American expressionists who, despite the differences in their subjects, share a commitment to visual storytelling. (Dee Rees’s “Pariah” falls into this camp, too.) Words remain crucial for these filmmakers, of course. But they use visual style to express inner worlds, and show interiority instead of explaining it, unlike some of their chattier, more TV-ready peers. Cinematic expressionism is most associated with German film of the 1920s, but can be found across genres and in the work of artists as diverse as Martin Scorsese, Claire Denis, Tony Scott, Terrence Malick and Gaspar Noé. Shults seems to nod both at Noé (in a red-steeped scene throbbing with bass and violence) and at Jenkins, specifically in the vision of Tyler and his girlfriend embracing in a blur of deep blue water. The beauty of this moment, evoking the oceanic feeling, pierces the heart. It conveys Tyler’s connection to his girlfriend and to the world, which in turn seems to hold the lovers in its embrace. Here, the self and the universe are as one. Shults seems to be suggesting a similar holistic sensibility when his pirouetting camera draws circles around characters, most notably in mirrored scenes of the siblings, each riding in a car with a lover. (A very good Lucas Hedges plays Emily’s boyfriend.) All of Shults’s stylistic brio and formal inventiveness is finally in the service of a story about love, its mutability and fragility. He avoids political grandstanding, creating a narrative rationale for the tragedy. But he also connects it to the institutionalized violence that Ronald refers to in his talk with Tyler and which, simply by virtue of being African-American, hangs over this family, threatening it and its love. When the screen turns into a blur of color, this time from whirring police-car lights, the dread it illuminates on Ronald’s face speaks louder and far more hauntingly than words. Waves Rated R for bloody violence. Running time: 2 hours 15 minutes."
207,Frozen II,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/movies/frozen-2-review.html,"“Let It Go,” the warble heard around the world, wasn’t just the signature song from “Frozen.” It was an anthem (“Here I stand!”) for the mighty, mighty girl power that helped push Disney into industry dominance. The company’s supremacy is often pinned on its highest profile franchises: Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar, which have historically featured male-driven stories. But Disney has also heavily profited from a sparkly pink world of adventure and aspirational uplift for spirited girls and women who “dream big,” to borrow a motto from its princess franchise. The sisters from “Frozen,” the magical Elsa (the leather-lunged Idina Menzel) and the younger, perkily ordinary Anna (Kristen Bell, a honeyed soprano) aren’t part of the official princess juggernaut. Maybe that’s because Elsa was crowned queen in the first movie, though also because the sisters are big enough to have their very own franchise, having raked in a billion plus worldwide. So, of course they are back for another round of global domination in “Frozen 2,” a diverting, prettily animated musical, again written by Jennifer Lee, who directed the movie with Chris Buck. “Frozen” neatly tied things up with Elsa having embraced her magic and wearing the crown, and Anna matched with a nice bland hunk, Kristoff (Jonathan Groff). But there’s no such thing as happily ever after in Franchise Land. So, after the reintroductions (hello, Olaf and Sven), Elsa performs a call-and-response with an ethereally pure voice, a “secret siren” (the Norwegian singer Aurora), in “Into the Unknown.” True to her new musical grail, Elsa ventures off into the unknown, followed by Anna, and together they climb the mountain, touch the sky and re-enter the circle of life. The ensuing adventure is lively, amusing and predictably predictable with revelations, reconciliations and some nebulous politics for the grown-ups. It’s never surprising, yet its bursts of pictorial imagination — snowflakes that streak like shooting stars — keep you engaged, as do Elsa and Anna, who still aren’t waiting for life to happen. They’re searching, not settled, both active and reactive, which even today makes them female-character outliers on the big screen. Even better, this time this journey isn’t as tethered to romance. Kristoff yearns to propose to Anna and spends much of the story fumbling to pop the question, a light comic refrain that smartly never overwhelms the story. Instead, the emphasis remains on the sisters. In “Frozen,” Anna found true love with Kristoff, but mostly she and Elsa found each other. It was a promising change of genre pace particularly given that Disney has long drawn from classic fairy tales (its first animated feature was “Snow White”), which it has struggled to recalibrate for changing gender norms. With “Frozen” it created grown heroines with different once-upon-a-time stories, one sealed with a man’s kiss, the other happily not. It was a modest liberating détournement along the lines of the first “Maleficent,” a rethink of Sleeping Beauty in which a kiss from a motherly queen, not a prince, wakes the princess. “Frozen 2” continues in the same nonthreatening, emancipatory vein, jumping to life when Elsa responds to the siren’s call. As before, the songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are pleasantly melodious with lyrics that can have the quality of a confession, as if a friend were sharing her inner-voice struggles: “I’m afraid of what I’m risking if I follow you.” One of the sweetest tunes, “All Is Found,” appears in a flashback with Elsa and Anna’s mother (Evan Rachel Wood), who introduces an animistic motif (“a river full of memory”) while readying her daughters for the future with the Disney Dare: “Can you brave what you most fear?” Well of course they can. As is often true in animation, “Frozen 2” soars highest when it embraces abstraction, as in one number with a pitch-black void that entertainingly evokes Jonathan Glazer’s “Under the Skin.” These moments enrich the storytelling as do Menzel and Bell, who give Elsa and Anna feeling, not simply pluck. This adds dimensions to their sisterly quest, even if the harmonious emotions and good intentions never fully atone for the conventionalism of the blond-on-blond character design, the tiny waists, pert breasts, jeweled eyes and pale plastic-y skin. Hearing women sing of freedom is irresistible, but Disney needs to take its old-fashioned ideal of female beauty and just, well, let it go. Frozen 2 Rated PG for mild peril. Running time: 1 hour 43 minutes."
208,A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/movies/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-review.html,"“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” celebrates the virtues of patient listening, gentleness and the honest expression of feelings. It’s about how a man who has devoted his life to being kind helps a man with a professional investment in skepticism to become a little nicer. The appeal of such a movie at the present moment is obvious enough, and so perhaps are the risks. This modest, quiet story — based on a magazine article published more than 20 years ago — could easily have turned into something preachy, sentimental and overstated. Mister Rogers — the real, off-camera Fred Rogers as well as the version of himself he played on television — was none of those things. His decency, and what we now might call his emotional intelligence, presented themselves with a serene consistency that could be a little unnerving. That’s how Rogers sometimes struck Tom Junod in “Can You Say … Hero?,” the Esquire profile that inspired Marielle Heller’s film. And that’s how the movie’s Mister Rogers, played by Tom Hanks, often strikes Lloyd Vogel, a fictional character who, like Junod, writes for Esquire and had a favorite childhood toy called Old Rabbit. Those are the main similarities, other than Mister Rogers himself, between the movie and its source material. “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” which was written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, is not a biopic of Rogers, or for that matter of Junod (who revisited his friendship with Rogers in a recent Atlantic article). Lloyd, played by Matthew Rhys, is a familiar type of fictional character: a soul in torment, a guy who has lost touch with his better self. He has a kindhearted wife, Andrea (Susan Kelechi Watson), a new baby, and a recent National Magazine Award, but his resting dude face hovers perpetually between sorrow and disgust. The main source of this anguish is his father, Jerry (Chris Cooper), an old-school drinker and philanderer from whom Lloyd has been estranged for most of his adult life. The two get into a fistfight at a family wedding, and Lloyd rebuffs Jerry’s later attempts at reconciliation. The assignment to write a short profile of Mister Rogers, pushed on Lloyd by his editor (Christine Lahti), turns out to be something of a miracle, a just-in-time divine intervention. The religious language feels apt — Rogers, an ordained Protestant minister, begins every morning with Scripture and prayer — but also possibly misleading. When Lloyd, speaking to Joanne Rogers (Maryann Plunkett), describes her husband, a bit sardonically, as “a saint,” she corrects him. He’s an ordinary sinner like anyone else. And though it would be a mistake to call Rogers nonjudgmental, his moral authority arises from empathy rather than superiority. His young viewers trust him because he speaks to them without condescension or pandering, and also without pretending he is anything other than a grown-up. (To them he’s not “Fred,” but always Mister Rogers, and he always wears a necktie under his zippered cardigan.) His basic advice to fellow adults — “you were once a child, too” — suggests a tactful challenge to something St. Paul said in I Corinthians 13. You don’t put away childish things, like favorite toys and hurt feelings. You hold onto them, because they become touchstones of empathy, reminders of the vulnerability and sincerity that are the building blocks of the mature self. But unlike “Won’t You Be My Neighbor,” Morgan Neville’s heartfelt 2018 documentary, “Beautiful Day” is not primarily about Rogers’s work in children’s television. It’s about how his friendship helps Lloyd become a more forgiving son, a more responsive husband and a more involved father. There is an off-the-shelf quality to this story, which brushes up against more than a few self-help screenwriting clichés. But Heller, as in her previous films (“The Diary of a Teenage Girl” and “Can You Ever Forgive Me?”), trusts in the power of small moments and the appeal of human idiosyncrasy. She also makes charming use of the miniature architecture of the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, weaving a bright thread of fantasy into Lloyd’s troubled reality. It’s not only Mister Rogers’s kindness that hovers over “Beautiful Day,” but also his creative spirit. Paying tribute to his skills as a composer, performer and puppeteer, the movie affirms his status as a hero of the imagination. Which is not an easy role for an actor to play. Without descending to overt mimicry, Hanks captures Rogers’s body language and vocal intonations, and his own firmly established reputation for niceness adds an important element of credibility. But while it’s hard to imagine any other American actor playing Mr. Rogers, I can’t help but think that Hanks is miscast. He is a natural extrovert, expressive and energetic, as friendly as a Labrador retriever with a bit of bulldog stubbornness mixed in. Rogers was kind of the opposite: an essentially feline temperament — one of his main puppet alter egos was the exquisitely timid Daniel Striped Tiger — and one of the few introverts to become a mass-media celebrity. He had a stillness, a shyness, a slightly melancholy reserve that anchored the trust of his young viewers. Unlike so many of the other adults we encountered, he wasn’t talking at us. He seemed to be listening. Hanks performs this with faultless technique, but you never lose sight of the performance. Rogers demurs when Lloyd describes him as a “celebrity,” but this film, in spite of its skill and sincerity, can’t find anything else for him to be. He seems larger than life, an idol if not a saint. All he wanted was to be your neighbor. A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Rated PG. Some hard feelings, and tips for dealing with them. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes."
209,21 Bridges,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/movies/21-bridges-review.html,"Hedging its bets, the manhunt movie “21 Bridges” both flatters and reviles the police. On the one hand, its somber hero, a remorseless homicide detective named Davis (Chadwick Boseman), is the closest thing the N.Y.P.D. has to a perp whisperer. On the other, Davis manages to shoot almost one suspect a month. Unapologetic about his kill rate, he explains to Internal Affairs that they all deserved their fates, so let’s move on, shall we? Davis’s trigger finger — and a citywide police conspiracy — will be unduly tested when a cocaine heist goes awry and the thieves (Stephan James and Taylor Kitsch) escape by slaughtering eight police officers. Springing into action, Davis orders a complete blockade of Manhattan; with no way off the island, he and his blue army have just one night to catch the killers before the city implodes. Start the clock! All else aside, the bullet budget for “21 Bridges” must have been off the charts. Spraying what seems like several thousand rounds of ammunition, this sturdy thriller (the big-screen feature debut of the director Brian Kirk) has no patience for nuance. It’s a big, blunt, battering ram of a movie, but it’s not dumb: The stunts are sharply executed, the actors (including Sienna Miller and J.K. Simmons) unimpeachable and Paul Cameron’s lively camera turns the streets of Philadelphia into a credible-enough Manhattan. The dialogue might be boilerplate (“You wear that badge, I got your back!”), but, let’s face it, if any of its patrons are crestfallen, it won’t be because of its lack of ten-dollar words. 21 Bridges Rated R for cocaine and carnage. Running time: 1 hour 39 minutes."
210,Dark Waters,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/movies/dark-waters-review.html,"Outrage mixes with despair in “Dark Waters,” an unsettling, slow-drip thriller about big business and the people who become its collateral damage. It’s a fictional take on a true, ghastly story about a synthetic polymer that was discovered by a chemist at DuPont, which branded it Teflon. One of those seemingly magical substances of the modern age, Teflon was advertised as an “amazing new concept in cooking,” a 20th-century wonder meant to make life easier. “Choose a pan like you choose a man,” a British ad for a Teflon-coated pan suggested. “It’s what’s on the inside that counts.” What was inside Teflon, anyway? In “Dark Waters,” the answer starts with cows that belong to Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), a West Virginia farmer engorged with rage, whose animals (and livelihood) are horribly and inexplicably dying on his pastoral-looking land. He has his suspicions about the cause, but the deaths are an enigma that becomes a murder mystery that, in turn, opens into a legal inquiry into corporate malfeasance and government accountability. Leading the charge is Rob Bilott (Mark Ruffalo), a corporate lawyer in Cincinnati who defended chemical companies but became an unlikely crusader for the other side when he went up against DuPont. Opening the story with a spooky prologue right out of the horror handbook, the director Todd Haynes makes it clear that here be monsters: It’s 1975 and a gaggle of young trespassers venture onto fenced-off property to go for a night swim. (The script is by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan.) Soon after the swimmers splash into the dark, oily waters (kids do the stupidest things), they are rousted by a booming male voice of authority. Given the horror-film setup, you half expect a creature from this dark lagoon to rise up or a chain-saw killer to buzz into view. Instead, men in a boat marked “containment” glide in, spraying something on the slicked surface. The time-hopping story then skips decades ahead to Wilbur and his brother (Jim Azelvandre) carrying a stash of videotapes into Taft, Bilott’s bustling firm. Wilbur has found Bilott through a connection to the lawyer’s grandmother (Marcia Dangerfield), who lives in West Virginia. It turns out that Bilott spent time as a child on Wilbur’s farm, which further deepens the men’s alliance. Bilott dives in, despite some unpersuasive reluctance. Defending small farmers isn’t in his portfolio and he has just been made a partner; but Bilott is a good guy, which the casting of the deeply empathetic Ruffalo has telegraphed from the moment his character appears. What happens next is by turns tense and turgid, unsurprising and appalling. Bilott, with begrudging support of his firm (Tim Robbins plays his boss), confirms Wilbur’s worst fears: the local DuPont plant has been dumping toxic waste on land next to the Tennant farm. In a queasy causal chain, the waste has seeped into the soil and migrated into the creek that flows through the farmer’s property and supplies water for his cows. This revelation leads Bilott to confront the DuPont powers that be and face down a larger nightmare filled with the misuse of science and the abuse of people.  On paper, at least, this seems familiar territory for Haynes, whose art-house breakout, “Safe,” focuses on a middle-class woman affected by environmental illness. In that film, there is finally no immunity from the modern world (it isn’t a safe space), a moral that resurfaces with grisly horror in “Dark Waters.” Despite the environmental connection, though, the new movie is more conventional than Haynes’s usual work in its narrative structure and approach to the material. It’s exceedingly well executed and technically impeccable, with precisely shot (by Edward Lachman), near-abstract, dehumanized cityscapes washed in gray set against darkly shaded country landscapes that seem permanently untouched by sun. Too bad then that as the years slip away and Bilott’s wife, Sarah (Anne Hathaway), continues to huff and puff about him and his work, the movie slides into banality. It’s disappointing that Haynes hasn’t solved the recurrent problem of the Wife, that irritating, waiting, nagging yet loving stereotype. The story here, of course, is about Bilott’s fight against DuPont. (It’s based on a 2016 article by Nathaniel Rich that was published in The New York Times Magazine.) But every time Bilott goes home it feels like a waste of valuable storytelling and investigative time, which only plays into the noxious idea that men do the important work in the world while women — a periodic whistle-blowing Erin Brockovich notwithstanding — impatiently tap their feet. You do feel Haynes’s touch now and again, particularly in the sense of menace that seeps into a crepuscular law office and in the everyday eeriness that suffuses outwardly ordinary homes that are anything but normal. Bilott’s investigation and the ensuing legal fight, which drags on for years, make it clear that the poison has leaked far beyond this stretch of West Virginia. But at its strongest, the movie makes you see that the poison that is killing Wilbur’s cows and so many other living things isn’t simply a question of toxic chemicals. There is, Haynes suggests, a deeper malignancy that has spread across a country that allows some to kill and others simply to die. Dark Waters Rated PG-13 for corporate malfeasance and poisoned living creatures. Running time: 2 hours 6 minutes."
211,Knives Out,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/movies/knives-out-review.html,"A sleek game of cat and mouse, “Knives Out” begins the hunt with a mysterious pool of blood and ends, well, telling wouldn’t be fair. The press screening that I attended was preceded by a brief video in which the writer and director Rian Johnson asked viewers not to spill the movie’s secrets. The entreaty suggests how seriously Johnson takes his own cleverly deployed twists and the challenges of keeping ostensible spoilers under wraps. The twists are kinked and amusing, although far less striking than the obvious pleasure he had making this exactingly machined puzzle box. Stuffed with famous and blurrily familiar faces, the movie takes the shape of an old-fashioned whodunit — the kind with mystery, suspense, entertainment, a corpse on an heirloom settee and a half-dozen or so shifty suspects milling about.  As in many genre exemplars, the main setting is a stately manor with dark corners, creaking stairs and a warren of richly appointed rooms shrouded in secrets. Together, the rooms create a claustrophobic maze, though they more pointedly resemble cabinets of curiosities with jumbles of books, dead animals, laughing masks, acres of rugs and eccentric objets. The house itself feels like a mousetrap, which works for a narrative puzzle in which the parts keep shifting as the wood-paneled walls close in. The overall sense of confinement is perfect for the aims of a private investigator, Benoit Blanc, a honey-baked ham played by Daniel Craig with grandiose self-regard and a Southern accent that seems borrowed from Kevin Spacey. There isn’t a butler in the parlor, but there is a rather too virtuous caretaker, Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), who worked for the manor’s imperious patriarch Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), who suddenly and rather flamboyantly croaks. Harlan is a charming monster, a type that Plummer excels in playing, and it’s a shame that he isn’t around longer. A renowned mystery writer, Harlan has written stacks of best sellers, amassing wealth and cultivating a grasping, desperate dependence in his avaricious family. Someone clearly had a good time coming up with the titles of his tomes, which read like winking clues or chapter headings: “Vulcan’s Den,” “The Badger,” “Nick of Time,” “Ultimatum,” “This Little Piggy.” A genre savant, Johnson understands that one of the pleasures of mystery stories is how they turn viewers into detectives, eager amateur sleuths who also sift through the clues, false and not.  Johnson scatters enough hints to keep you busy guessing as characters enter and exit amid abrupt cuts and flashbacks. Things get complicated, though they never deepen, which seems by design. “Knives Out” is essentially an energetic, showy take on a dusty Agatha Christie-style murder mystery, with interrogations, possible motives and dubious alibis. Soon after Harlan’s body is discovered, the law (Lakeith Stanfield and Noah Segan) questions the family, a finely curated collection of gargoyles presided over by a crisp Jamie Lee Curtis and a leaden Michael Shannon as Harlan’s children, and rounded out by Don Johnson, Chris Evans and Toni Collette, among others. You spend a lot of time with Benoit and Marta, who are never as engaging as the size of their roles suggest they’re meant to be. Benoit’s part in the investigation is another mystery; he sniffs around like its lead dog but mostly comes across as a delectable chew toy for the director. When you first meet Benoit, he is sitting in an armchair, a nod to a genre staple and some teasing misdirection: He is, you soon appreciate, a hands-on sleuth if not an especially penetrative one. He presses witnesses, roams the grounds and sticks close to Marta, the most sympathetic and sentimentalized character in a movie that otherwise exhibits an exuberant skepticism about human nature. As the inquiry builds, the suspects are stripped of their defenses, exposing pettiness, sharp teeth, false fronts and one pure heart. Johnson fills the frame with looming heads, folds in a nifty car chase and, in a striking tableau, sets loose the hounds. M. Emmet Walsh (who appeared in the Coen brothers’ “Blood Simple”) pops in, as does a photo of the magician Ricky Jay, who died before he could play Walsh’s role. Johnson’s own sleight of hand is estimable, even if his effort to add politics into the crowded mix rings hollow. The machine is what matters here, and he has clearly had such a good time engineering it that it’s hard not to feel bad when you don’t laugh along with him. Knives Out Rated PG-13 for blood on the floor. Running time: 2 hours 10 minutes."
212,Queen & Slim,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/movies/queen-and-slim-review.html,"“I’m an excellent lawyer,” Queen says to Slim, at a time in their brief acquaintance when legal skills seem both urgently needed and wholly irrelevant. Slim is not impressed. “Why do black people always have to be excellent?” he asks. “Why can’t we just be normal?” The question has a special poignancy at the moment he asks it. Before everything went haywire, he and Queen — whose given names we learn only at the very end of the movie, via a news broadcast — were in the middle of a perfectly, depressingly normal evening. “Queen & Slim,” the debut feature by the music-video and television virtuoso Melina Matsoukas (written by Lena Waithe), starts out as a restrained comedy of romantic disappointment. The title pair — played by the British actors Jodie Turner-Smith and Daniel Kaluuya — are in a diner after connecting on a dating app, and the lack of chemistry is palpable. She seems impatient and distracted. He seems sincere and friendly, but maybe also a little basic. They get into his car, a nondescript white sedan with a license plate that reads “TRUSTGOD.” It’s a cold night in Cleveland, and a second date is unlikely. God and the filmmakers have other plans. A lethal encounter with an aggressive white police officer (the country singer Sturgill Simpson) changes everything. The non-couple turn into fugitives, and “Queen & Slim” becomes an outlaw romance. Hailed in the film as “the black Bonnie and Clyde,” Queen and Slim evoke other storied movie duos too, like Butch and Sundance and Thelma and Louise. In the course of their flight — from Ohio to New Orleans and across the South toward Florida — they become folk heroes. They also fall in love. “I’m not a criminal,” Slim protests, early in the journey. It’s the flip side of his earlier complaint about excellence. The world wants him to be either a paragon or a pariah, denying his individuality, his specific dreams and desires. That’s the beautiful, terrible paradox of this movie: only as its heroes are driven to extremes of desperation, courage and resilience do they experience passions and pleasures that might have been part of ordinary life. “Queen & Slim” is full of violence and danger, but it isn’t a hectic, plot-driven caper. Its mood is dreamy, sometimes almost languorous, at least as invested in the aesthetics of life on the run as it is in the politics of black lives. Not that the two are separable. The image of Queen and Slim that is reproduced on protest T-shirts and murals shows them striking stylized poses in borrowed clothes, leaning against the vintage Pontiac that carries them on the second half of their journey. The car belongs to Queen’s Uncle Earl (Bokeem Woodbine), who lives in New Orleans in a polyamorous arrangement that might also be a moneymaking operation. An Iraq war veteran with a complicated past, he is one of a handful of vivid characters we meet along the way. Dashcam images of what happened in Ohio have gone viral, stripping Queen and Slim of anonymity and turning every encounter into a tense guessing game. Will this person help us out? Turn us in? Rip us off? The answers are sometimes comical — Slim’s attempt to rob a gas station, for example — sometimes terrifying, and sometimes both at once, and they don’t emerge in simple black and white. Racism in America can be stark and brutal, but it isn’t always simple. People who look like allies turn out to be enemies, and vice versa. Ironies and contradictions abound, even as some of the basic facts assert themselves with blunt, oppressive force. Queen and Slim’s goal is to find a pilot who will fly them to Cuba, a destination that links them to the history of black radicalism. Their drive along the back roads of Alabama and Georgia is propelled by a soundtrack that is equally history-minded, with deep hip-hop and R&B selections strung along  Devonté Hynes’s mood-altering score. The music mirrors the film’s album-like structure. Even as the plot moves forward in a straight line, its episodes have their own shape and integrity. Not every cut is a classic. A burst of violence, indirectly connected to Queen and Slim, feels jarring and overwrought, especially because of the way it’s intercut with a sex scene — a mash-up that produces more cacophony than intensity. A bit of back story involving Queen and Uncle Earl is similarly ill-considered. The film fumbles some of its big gestures and over-italicizes a few statements. What lingers, though, are strains of anger, ardor, sorrow and sweetness, and the quiet astonishment of witnessing the birth of a legend. This movie feels like something new, and also as if it’s been around forever, waiting for its moment. Queen & Slim Rated R. Love and death. Running time: 2 hours 12 minutes."
213,The Two Popes,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/movies/the-two-popes-review.html,"“The Two Popes” is really three movies: a behind-the-scenes tale of Vatican politics, a mini-biopic about the current pontiff, and a two-man study of friendship, rivalry and major British acting. The first, though intriguing, is more puzzling than illuminating. The second feels a bit like a Wikipedia page, albeit one with first-rate cinematography. The third is absolutely riveting, a subtle and engaging double portrait that touches on complicated matters of faith, ambition and moral responsibility. Directed by Fernando Meirelles (“City of God,” “The Constant Gardener”) from a screenplay by Anthony McCarten (“Darkest Hour,” “Bohemian Rhapsody”), the film begins in 2005, after the death of Pope John Paul II. The cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church gather at St. Peter’s to elect a successor, settling on Joseph Ratzinger (Anthony Hopkins), who becomes Pope Benedict XVI. The runner-up is Jorge Bergoglio (Jonathan Pryce), an Argentine priest who will replace Benedict eight years later, becoming Pope Francis in a highly unusual transfer of ecclesiastical authority. That’s hardly a spoiler, but “The Two Popes” observes the transition with an attention to detail that produces a surprising degree of suspense. In 2013, Bergoglio, who seems more at home on the motley streets of Buenos Aires than in the hushed baroque chambers of the Vatican, travels to Rome to ask the pope’s permission to retire. Benedict, receiving his visitor at the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, has other plans, though they aren’t clear at first. What is clear is that the two men, who may be brothers in Christ, are not friends. “I disagree with everything you say,” Benedict snaps at one point, and while their conversation is marked by deference and decorum, the temperamental and ideological gulf between them seems unbridgeable. Bergoglio is impatient with Benedict’s hard line on social and cultural issues, arguing that the church should use its moral influence to address issues like climate change and economic inequality. Benedict is a voice of authority and tradition. What Bergoglio sees as necessary change, Benedict views as ruinous compromise. When they argue semantics and swat at each other’s metaphors — Bergoglio says he wants to break down walls; Benedict replies that “a house needs walls” — what is at stake is the future of the church itself. “The Two Popes” isn’t altogether neutral in this debate, which takes place against a backdrop of scandal and crisis. The film uses snippets of television news and remarks from lay people to remind viewers of the revelations of sexual abuse and financial malfeasance plaguing the church, but it also tries, somewhat awkwardly, not to dwell on those problems. This is partly because the filmmakers want us to see Bergoglio as a redemptive figure, a man who has faced up to his own failures with humility and whose ascension to the papacy portends an era of reform and renewal. My own view on the matter is: I’m Jewish, and also temperamentally more inclined to ponder secular details than sacred mysteries. But when Benedict and Bergoglio are together — first at the castle and then, in the film’s most beautiful section, in a small room abutting the Sistine Chapel — the actors draw out both the spiritual and the psychological dimensions of their characters. The interplay, a duet with sweet and eccentric harmonies, is fascinating to observe, even as it undermines the overall structure of the narrative. That edifice is at once intellectually rigid and formally rickety. If “The Two Popes” had consisted entirely of two old men talking, it might have been a masterpiece. But the conversation is interrupted by flashbacks that chronicle Bergoglio’s early life, as a young scientist called to the priesthood and as head of the Jesuit order in Argentina during the military dictatorship of the 1970s. (In those scenes he is played by Juan Minujín.)  This biographical excursion is hardly irrelevant — it clarifies Bergoglio’s political views, and also his fallibility — but the information could have been conveyed in a less literal manner. It feels almost as if the filmmakers didn’t trust Pryce to tell the story, and that has the effect of flattening his performance. Bergoglio likes to proclaim his own simplicity. He is a man of the people and a man of the world. He wears sensible black lace-up shoes instead of velvet slippers. He chats amiably with gardeners and chauffeurs, dances the tango and is a passionate soccer fan. This may make him more appealing than Benedict, but it also makes him less intriguing. Pryce is an amiable, sympathetic presence, with legible facial expressions and an impressive ability to make himself understood in four of the five languages spoken onscreen. Hopkins, a bit of a historic hambone himself, cedes all the big gestures to Pryce and stealthily does some of his craftiest acting in years. He mutters and whispers, sighs and fidgets, and turns Benedict from a presumed villain into an almost tragic figure, a brilliant theoretical mind tethered to a complex and troubled soul. You may like Francis better — “The Two Popes” assumes, or maybe insists, that you will — but Benedict is the one who stays with you. The Two Popes Rated PG-13. Some scenes of violence. Running time: 2 hours 5 minutes."
215,The Aeronauts,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/movies/the-aeronauts-review.html,"To call “The Aeronauts” uplifting would be an understatement for a movie that shoots us into the sky in a gas-filled balloon with little preamble and a breathtaking array of special effects. Gorgeous and goofy, fanciful and unrepentantly old-fashioned, this Victorian adventure (it’s set in 1862) delights much more when its head is in the clouds than when its feet are on the ground. The wellspring of the movie’s joie de vivre is Amelia Wren (a wonderful Felicity Jones), a fearless balloonist with a tragic past and a gift for exhibitionism. The movie opens with a rush as she arrives at a launch site astride the roof of a carriage, her peacock-hued frock and feathered headdress fluttering gaily. The crowd is ecstatic as she cartwheels around the waiting balloon under the disapproving gaze of her flight partner, the meteorologist James Glaisher (Eddie Redmayne). Glaisher is taking the trip to test his theories of weather prediction — this being London, those mostly amount to determining the likelihood of a drizzle versus a downpour — and Amelia’s carnival antics annoy him. He’s even more miffed when, after liftoff, she flings her little dog, Posey, out of the basket, accompanied by a spray of fireworks. Calm yourself, James: Posey has a parachute. Swiftly establishing a stuffy-scientist-meets-sexy-daredevil dynamic, the director, Tom Harper, and his screenwriter, Jack Thorne, proceed to upend our gender expectations. While James fusses awkwardly with his pressure and altitude readings, Amelia is busily keeping them alive. The star of the movie in every way, she’s skilled and practical and brave: She’s the one with the common sense to bring oilskins and to recognize the dangers in the plummeting temperature and thinning air. That she also understands the benefits of publicity and showmanship is only a plus. A composite of several real-life balloon trips (Glaisher is real and Wren is fictitious, but likely based on the flamboyant French balloonist Sophie Blanchard), “The Aeronauts” has a natural buoyancy that mostly resists the drag of its earthbound flashbacks. Stuffy scenes between James and his parents (Tom Courtenay and Anne Reid) alternate with his entreaties for money from the Royal Society, where his bewhiskered fellow scientists think he’s a hoot. After a few of these interludes, neither we nor the movie can wait to get back in that basket with Amelia. Structural roadblocks aside, “The Aeronauts” is that rare adventure movie to celebrate the silence in which its wonders unfold. The cloud of butterflies that magically appears, and the flakes of snow that hover, seemingly stationary, around the balloon during its too-swift descent, are permitted to linger quietly on the screen and in the mind. At one point — in the film’s most terrifying sequence — as Amelia climbs up the balloon’s exterior to release a perilously frozen gas valve, George Steel’s cinematography has such a hushed and blinding beauty that it would be a crime to close your eyes. Equal parts dizzying and dippy, “The Aeronauts” is family entertainment at its most charming and chaste. By and by, you realize you’ve been watching a romance blossom without a single kiss, but that shouldn’t be a surprise: What James and Amelia are really in love with is the sky. The Aeronauts Rated PG-13. Vertigo medication all around. Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes."
216,A Million Little Pieces,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/movies/a-million-little-pieces-review.html,"Adapting James Frey’s infamously fictionalized memoir, “A Million Little Pieces,” the director Sam Taylor-Johnson niftily elides the book’s truthiness problem with an introductory quotation from Mark Twain. “I’ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened,” it reads, before we see a physically wrecked James (vividly played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, the director’s husband and screenwriting partner) slouched on a plane and headed to a Minnesota clinic. A substance abuser since childhood (crack and alcohol are his favorites), James is now 23 and one drink away from almost certain death. So begins yet another ruin-and-rehab tale, one that initially tantalizes then flatly disappoints. In an intensely physical performance, Taylor-Johnson leaps and writhes and trembles through treatment as James endures a root canal, a broken-nose reset and a clarinet-playing roommate — all without anesthesia. Yet there’s no hint of what drove him to destroy himself and not a single reason for the audience to invest in his recovery. Looking elsewhere for entertainment, we find an affable Billy Bob Thornton as a laid-back rehab regular, and a very touching Odessa Young as Lilly, James’s fragile love interest. Jeff Cronenweth’s cinematography is often eloquent and more creative than the script, especially in the film’s euphoric opening as James dances wildly, naked and out of his mind. Later, as he and Lilly slowly circle each other in an intimate, forbidden conversation, the camera hovers so protectively we wonder if it knows something that we don’t. Moments like these brighten a movie that’s otherwise dull and sadly unmemorable. Mostly, it just reminded me how much I enjoy Billy Bob Thornton. A Million Little Pieces Rated R for unmediated dentistry and unruly penises. Running time: 1 hour 53 minutes."
218,Jumanji: The Next Level,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/jumanji-the-next-level-review.html,"It’s only two weeks after Thanksgiving. A little early to have to contend with a new overstuffed turkey. And yet, here is “Jumanji: The Next Level.” This is the sequel to a 2017 reboot (again directed by Jake Kasdan), which connected mightily with audiences. In that movie, a quartet of teens got sucked into a video game that assigned them avatars, which also served as virtual life coaches. Wimpy Spencer got to inhabit Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a. the Rock), while shy Martha got to kick butt in Karen Gillan’s body. Self-absorbed Bethany got a soft comeuppance being Jack Black. And “Fridge,” a giant jock, got cut down to Kevin Hart’s stature. Here, on winter break, downhearted Spencer — his life hack didn’t quite take — has dug up the game and re-entered its world. His friends try to follow, but only a couple make it in. They are joined by Eddie, Spencer’s crotchety grandfather (a delightfully dyspeptic Danny DeVito) and Eddie’s estranged best pal, Milo (a warm Danny Glover). Yes, Eddie does wind up in Dwayne Johnson’s body, which affords Johnson the opportunity to try a New Jersey accent. It’s not bad. This all sounds more complicated than it plays out onscreen, which is to Kasdan’s credit. Adding to the twists is a body of water that enables avatar-switching; it reintroduces itself at a crucial story point, as one does. At another crucial point, the actress and rapper Awkwafina shows up to join in the ostensible fun; at another, Colin Hanks and Nick Jonas reprise their roles from the prior movie. It’s perhaps unfair to call this a turkey. It’s got some sweet moments, and the cast, as it did in the previous picture, enjoys itself at least semi-infectiously. But the action sequences are lifeless; the lessons valid but arguably stale; and the trimmings, mere bloat. Jumanji: The Next Level Rated PG-13 for video-game-style mayhem. Running time: 2 hours 3 minutes."
219,Richard Jewell,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/richard-jewell-review.html,"On July 27, 1996, a homemade bomb exploded at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, the host city for that year’s Summer Olympics. Two people died and 100 were hurt in the attack. It was carried out by an anti-abortion militant named Eric Rudolph, though he was not arrested until 2003, after he had bombed two women’s health clinics and a gay bar and spent five years as a fugitive in the woods of Appalachia. Rudolph’s name is mentioned near the end of “Richard Jewell,” Clint Eastwood’s new film about the aftermath of the Atlanta bombing. The movie, based on a book by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen, “The Suspect,” and a Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner, isn’t about the bomber, but rather about the security guard who found a backpack full of explosives and shrapnel under a bench and sounded the alarm. Nonetheless, the specter of domestic right-wing terrorism haunts the movie, an unseen and unnamed evil tearing at the bright fabric of American optimism. Eastwood, in nearly half a century as a major filmmaker and even longer as an axiom of popular culture, has chronicled the fraying of that cloth, and also plucked at a thread or two. “Richard Jewell,” with a screenplay by Billy Ray, is one of his more obviously political films, though not always in obvious ways. In spite of some efforts to interpret it as a veiled pro-Trump polemic, the film doesn’t track neatly with our current ideological agitations. The political fractures Eastwood exposes are more elemental than even the most ferocious partisanship. This is a morality tale — in a good way, mostly — about the vulnerability of the individual citizen in the face of state power and about the fate of a private person menaced by the machinery of publicity. Though he acts bravely and responsibly at a moment of crisis, Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) isn’t entirely a hero, and “Richard Jewell” doesn’t quite belong in the gallery with “Sully” and “American Sniper,” Eastwood’s other recent portraits of exceptional Americans in trying circumstances. As in “15:17 to Paris” and “The Mule,” he’s more interested here in exploring what happens to an ordinary man under extreme pressure. He also wants to show how a regular guy’s idiosyncrasies can seem like either warning signs or virtues, depending on who’s looking. We first meet Jewell about 10 years before the bombing, in a local office of the Small Business Administration, pushing a cart full of office supplies. That’s where he meets Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), an irascible lawyer who will become his champion later on. Jewell is polite, hard-working and prone to surprising, unsolicited acts of generosity. He keeps Bryant’s desk drawer stocked with Snickers bars. At Centennial Olympic Park in 1996, he hands out soft drinks to co-workers, police officers and other thirsty people. There might be something a little peculiar about him. Eastwood, Ray and Hauser (who is nothing short of brilliant) cleverly invite the audience to judge Jewell the way his tormentors eventually will: on the basis of prejudices we might not even admit to ourselves. He’s overweight. He lives with his mother, Bobi (Kathy Bates). He has a habit of taking things too seriously — like his job as a campus police officer at a small liberal-arts college — and of trying a little too hard to fit in. He treats members of the Atlanta Police Department and the F.B.I. like his professional peers, and seems blind to their condescension. “I’m law enforcement too” he says to the agents who are investigating him as a potential terrorist, with an earnestness that is both comical and pathetic. Most movies, if they bothered with someone like Jewell at all, would make fun of him or relegate him to a sidekick role. Eastwood, instead, makes the radical decision to respect him as he is, and to show how easily both his everyday shortcomings and his honesty and decency are distorted and exploited by the predators who descend on him at what should be his moment of glory. The main heavies are Tom Shaw, a stone-faced F.B.I. man played by Jon Hamm, and Kathy Scruggs, a reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It’s her reporting that sets off a feeding frenzy in the newspapers and on the airwaves, including a painful moment when Bobi sees her beloved Tom Brokaw saying terrible things about her son. That is real footage. Scruggs, played by Olivia Wilde, was a real person (she died in 2001). Tom Shaw was not — the F.B.I. agents have been renamed in the movie — and the implication that Scruggs had sex with him in exchange for information about the bombing case has no apparent basis in reality. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has threatened legal action against Warner Bros. for the way its journalists, Scruggs in particular, are portrayed in the film, and the studio has pushed back. On strictly dramatic grounds, the character is, at best, a collection of lazy, sexist screenwriting clichés. That isn’t so unusual in Hollywood, but what’s worse is that Eastwood and Ray subject Scruggs — depicted as a newsroom mean girl with nothing but scorn for her female colleagues — to a type of profiling analogous to what Jewel endured. Assuming that an ambitious woman journalist must be sleeping with her sources isn’t all that different from assuming that a fat man who lives with his mother must have planted a bomb. In that respect, then, “Richard Jewell” undermines its own argument. But it happens to be a pretty strong argument, and one that takes Eastwood in some surprising directions. I would not have expected to see a heartfelt defense of Miranda rights in a movie directed by the former Dirty Harry, or a critique of F.B.I. overreach from the maker of a sympathetic J. Edgar Hoover biopic. I don’t think this is simply a matter of adapting to the political winds of the moment, now that distrust of the F.B.I., long a staple of the left, seems to have shifted rightward. Eastwood has always had a stubborn libertarian streak, and a fascination with law enforcement that, like Jewell’s, is shadowed by ambivalence and outright disillusionment. The shadows are what linger from this flawed, fascinating movie. As usual with Eastwood, it is shot (by Yves Bélanger) and edited (by Joel Cox) in a clean, blunt, matter-of-fact style. The story moves in a straight line, gathering momentum and suspense even as it lingers over odd, everyday moments. It doesn’t feel especially complicated or textured until it’s almost finished: Like Jewell himself, you may struggle to comprehend the implications of what is happening, and to grasp the stakes. “Richard Jewell” is a rebuke to institutional arrogance and a defense of individual dignity, sometimes clumsy in its finger-pointing but mostly shrewd and sensitive in its effort to understand its protagonist and what happened to him. The political implications of his ordeal are interesting to contemplate, but its essential nature is clear enough. He was bullied. Richard Jewell Rated R. Terrorist violence and state power. Running time: 2 hours 9 minutes."
220,Black Christmas,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/black-christmas-review.html,"If all you wanted for Christmas was a smarter “Black Christmas,” you are in luck. The director Sophia Takal, who wrote the screenplay with the film critic April Wolfe, has taken the 1974 Canadian sorority slasher standard — remade once before, in 2006 — and run with it, emerging with a movie significantly different in style and tone from its source. This “Black Christmas” speaks to an era of campus curriculum debates and a national reckoning over the reporting of sexual assault. (Takal says she drew inspiration from the Kavanaugh hearings.) Instead of prank phone calls, it has strangers sliding into your direct messages. The bustle of activity mitigates a central implausibility of earlier versions, whose characters seemed slow to notice the missing women. The sorority’s sisters are preparing for a talent show at which they plan to call out a graduated frat boy who raped the heroine, Riley (Imogen Poots), and escaped punishment. (This time, the police’s hand-waving of complaints is not portrayed as funny.) Kris (Aleyse Shannon) is circulating a petition against a plummy professor (Cary Elwes) who favors white male authors. Some of the new ideas are silly. Bows and arrows are tough to make look scary onscreen, and a supernatural element — the college’s founder dabbled in the dark arts — undermines the movie’s grounding in the here and now. But if the 2019 “Black Christmas” is not nearly as chilling as the original, it is genuinely barbed as gender satire, and it cleverly pre-empts obvious outrage. Horrified men may consider that its assessment is no more damning than that of “The Stepford Wives,” a male creation. They might also ponder that they are now forced to answer for self-appointed defenders of the “masculine spirit” like the Canadian academic Jordan Peterson, at whose worldview this “Black Christmas” takes implicit aim. Black Christmas Rated PG-13. Less gore than expected. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes."
221,6 Underground,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/movies/6-underground-review.html,"If the B-movie director Andy Sidaris were alive today, he’d be pretty ticked off about “6 Underground,” now streaming on Netflix. In 1979, Sidaris, whose low-budget actioners were generously cast with Playboy Playmates who shot guns and shed their tops with diligent reliability, made “Seven,” in which a master assassin deployed a team of seven specialized killers to take out drug traffickers in Hawaii. “6 Underground,” the budget of which could probably have funded at least 500 Sidarises, stars Ryan Reynolds as a self-ghosted billionaire in charge of a team of five other espionage specialists out to “do something” about “the evil in this world.” Directed by Michael Bay with his customary fast-cutting, low-angle-semi-circling-camera, huge-destruction-of-real-and-simulated-property style, “6 Underground” isn’t a wholly blatant Sidaris rip. For instance, Bay flirts with female nudity, as usual, but never crosses the line. The R rating here is earned with blood and gouged eyeballs. Reynold’s character is like Deadpool filtered through Elon Musk, if Elon Musk were cool, or “cool.” But his performance feels a little disinterested. Hardly matters. The movie opens with a high-speed car chase during which one of the team has bullet-extraction surgery in the back seat. And that’s almost 20 minutes right there. Engineering a coup in a geopolitical hot spot so vaguely rendered it could be Middle Eastern or South Asian, the gang performs a “Penthouse Extraction” (sounds like what 1970s teen boys did with the magazines their dads hid in the garage). This involves compromising the integrity of an infinity pool with extreme prejudice and then, parkour, parkour, parkour. When it comes to turning up action to 11, Bay is incorrigible. Not just with sound and fury; there are genuinely eccentric innovations here. There’s certainly not a whole lot of recognizable humanity, but hey, that’s why there’s “It’s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.” 6 Underground Rated R for blood, gouged eyeballs, and much more gore. Running time: 2 hours 7 minutes."
222,Bombshell,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/bombshell-review.html,"Bright and bouncy until it turns grim, “Bombshell” is a fictionalized account of the women who brought down Roger Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of Fox News. Helped bring him down is probably more accurate given that he was ousted by Rupert Murdoch, who founded Fox News in 1996 before handing the reins to Ailes. Since then, the network has become a ratings powerhouse and hothouse of right-wing talking points, a sea of white faces and dolled-up women in skirts and high heels. Ailes is now gone but the talking points, high ratings, skirts and heels remain. The movie’s title is clever, cleverness being its modus operandi. The story, after all, is about female employees who, with icy smiles and iron ambition, worked for a conservative political force who institutionalized the harassment of women. So, how do you make heroines out of characters that some in the audience will see as deeply compromised if not outright villainous? For starters, you cast on the offensive by having Charlize Theron play Megyn Kelly, Nicole Kidman do Gretchen Carlson and Margot Robbie break hearts as the fictional Kayla Pospisil.  The stars, with their unimpeachable talent, filmographies and feminist cred, are a shrewd way of blunting skepticism. Even so, the characters are tricky, especially Megyn and Gretchen, who come with ideological baggage that complicates Hollywood’s holy grail of relatability. The movie wants, needs us to like them, which may be why it breaks the fourth wall early on with Megyn directly addressing the audience, looking into the camera as she tours the network offices in a slightly tight red, white and blue dress. One man yells out a compliment, another looks her up and down. She keeps on walking, focused, hips swinging like knives. Having her talk to the viewer immediately makes the audience part of a very special Megyn Kelly tour group. It creates intimacy, almost a little conspiracy between you and her, so when she starts chatting about Roger (John Lithgow, galumphing with verve), including his history advising Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, you lean in and listen. Tell us more. You’re getting the inside dope from one of the network’s biggest stars. When Megyn says that Roger is always watching and we see the many surveillance monitors inside his own personal panopticon, it brings a shiver. Tell us everything. Directed by Jay Roach, from a script by Charles Randolph (“The Big Short”), “Bombshell” opens not long before the first Republican presidential candidates’ debate in August 2015. Kelly moderated it with two other Fox News anchors, but she was the one who drew national attention because of her questioning of Donald J. Trump and what it wrought. “You once told a contestant on ‘Celebrity Apprentice’ it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees,” Kelly said. “Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president?” Afterward, Trump said she had “behaved very badly” and went on a Twitter rampage against her. Here’s the thing about sexism: It doesn’t discriminate. It’s an equal opportunity prejudice that cuts across history, culture, political affiliation. “Bombshell” gets this. And part of what works in the movie is that it does a good job of presenting the ordinary assaults that women, even those with great privilege, can endure simply to get through a day, including dehumanizing “compliments.” When Megyn walks through the network as men size her up, she doesn’t break stride. She keeps marching. She’s a warrior and Theron makes you believe that with her ramrod posture and absolute assurance, Megyn could lead an army or maybe a rebellion, if she chose. Will she or won’t she? That’s the question teased for a long time in “Bombshell,” which gains steam as Trump’s assault stirs up trouble for Megyn. (Roach incorporates archival material of the real candidate throughout, amping up the movie’s historical bona fides.) Narratively, Megyn’s insistence on calling Trump out for his treatment for women — and then dealing with the ominous backlash — becomes a prelude to the looming crisis with Roger. She is the network’s biggest female star and she’s willing to take on a presidential candidate; as Roger says, it’s good TV. But when Gretchen sues Roger for sexual harassment, Megyn at first lets the other woman twist in the wind. Roach started out directing comedies and his background generally works for him in “Bombshell,” which he gives a lightness of touch in the beginning that promises (rightly, sometimes wrongly) everything will work out just fine. He even brings a sense of breezy fun to Fox that suggests everyone will soon be amusingly skewered. (The cinematographer Barry Ackroyd brings the texture, shadows and professional sheen.) With its big hair, shiny sets and the gun-packing Sean Hannity, the network is grist for parody, though it can be tough to tell who’s in on the joke. (The cast includes Kate McKinnon, Richard Kind, Allison Janney and a devilish Malcolm McDowell.) “Bombshell” works as well and as long as it does largely because of its actors, Theron most of all. One of her qualities as a performer is that she never begs for the audience’s love. She can come across as remote, but she also reads as supremely self-contained: She’s a fortress of one. She shows you her characters’ existential isolation, which is often where their humanity lies. You see that in “Bombshell,” which strengthens its realism and is finally more impressive than the prosthetics she wears that, with a husky scrape in her voice, turn her into Kelly’s uncanny double. Even when the movie puts some feminist-lite uplift on this ugly world, Theron doesn’t soften Megyn. Kidman is comparatively sidelined, though it’s Gretchen who knocks over the first domino. (The Showtime limited series about Ailes’s downfall, “The Loudest Voice,” foregrounds Carlson.) For the most part, Kidman plays Gretchen sincerely, though Roach over-sentimentalizes the character, especially with periodic cutaways to her children. But Kidman also makes Gretchen ever-so-slightly ridiculous, adding a sharp sliver of comedy that underscores how self-serving and futile her rebellious gestures at the network are, like when she appears on camera wearing no makeup. You will never win the war, the movie implies, by working for the enemy. That critique only goes so far in “Bombshell,” which finally can’t deal with the story’s uncomfortable contradictions. So instead it makes you cry, notably with Kayla, a self-described evangelical millennial in the “Jesus space.” Robbie deepens the movie’s emotional stakes as its persuasively sweet golden girl, who is brutalized by Roger. Roach handles this well enough, including in an upsetting scene in which Roger orders her to bare her white panties, a queasy emblem of surrender. But it is Robbie — with her panicked, darting eyes and tensely resistant, then capitulating physicality — who conveys the horror of sexual harassment, a degradation that seeps into body and soul. Kayla is the movie’s sacrificial lamb and, to an extent, a representation of female victimization and innocence. The problem in “Bombshell” is that Megyn and Gretchen have for years gone along with abusive male power to get along, at least while it was expedient for them. The movie personalizes this by having one woman call out another late in the story, rightly saying that if someone had sounded the alarm earlier maybe other victims might have been spared. But that wasn’t in Megyn and Gretchen’s self-interest, a truism that the movie can’t fully face. Ailes was awful, but he also had a lot of smiling help from the very women he made rich and famous. Bombshell Rated R for scenes of sexual harassment against women and crude language. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes."
223,Uncut Gems,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/uncut-gems-review.html,"“Uncut Gems,” the latest from the brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, blows in like a Category 4 hurricane. It’s a tumult of sensory extremes, of images and sounds, lurching shapes, braying voices, intensities of feeling and calculated craziness. So, naturally it stars — why not? — Adam Sandler as a cheat, liar, loving dad, bad husband, jealous lover and compulsive gambler who can’t stop, won’t stop acting the fool. The Safdies, two of the more playfully inventive filmmakers working in American cinema, won’t stop, either, which makes “Uncut Gems” fun if also wearying and at times annoying. It doesn’t seem to add up to much — a little man lives his life — but this is just enough. It’s easier to admire than to love, and I hate the ending, but the Safdies clearly like working your nerves. They’re not interested in the dumb, easy stuff movies give you — the likable, relatable characters, the sermonizing and moralizing; they’re too busy deploying color and noise, pushing the form, testing their (and our) limits. Amid this enjoyable chaos, Sandler plays Howard Ratner, who has a small jewelry store in the Diamond District of Manhattan. He has a few employees, one of whom is his mistress (Julia Fox), and an aggrieved wife (Idina Menzel) who’s fed up with him. He’s a careless family man, but he dotes on his sons and still clocks in for homey obligations. There’s a leisurely Passover Seder in the middle of the movie that’s suffused with love and alive with squalling kids, bustling women and well-padded men chewing cigars. But Howard has his plagues: He’s a gambler and presumably an unlucky one given the heavy debt that he’s carrying. Lots of stuff happens, lots and lots, and some of it can be hard to track. But the bedlam is intentional and amusing. All you need to do is latch onto Howard as he runs from here to there, yelling greetings, taking calls, making deals, always moving amid jump cuts, zooms and lurid close-ups. (The superb cinematography is by Darius Khondji, shooting on 35-millimeter film.) Howard’s dodging some toughs who work for a mystery man whom he owes big; the men are scary, bruisers with cruelty etched in their faces and no trace of the usual movie manicuring. One (Keith Williams Richards) punches Howard in the kisser, which is almost understandable. Written by the Safdies with their regular collaborator, the filmmaker Ronald Bronstein, “Uncut Gems” opens with a prologue, a familiar enough narrative strategy. It’s unusual, though, for the Safdies, as is the site: a mine in Ethiopia, where throngs of men are scrambling around a gravely wounded worker. The location shooting initially seems pointless (what happens could be conveyed in dialogue), and like the casting of Sandler, it broadcasts that they’re working with a higher budget. Structurally, the opener echoes the clichéd place-setting in Hollywood adventures, the ones with dashing heroes, offensively exoticized extras and maybe a mummy or two. More specifically, the dusty, enigmatic opener in “Uncut Gems” drolly echoes the start of “The Exorcist” (1973), where a priest at an archaeological dig in Iraq unearths the demonic relic that sets off the ensuing horror, the possession and spewing vomit. The magical discovery here is made by two Ethiopian miners, who sneak away from the bedlam to dig out a similar-looking lumpy rock. This turns out to be a huge black opal that soon ends up in Howard’s possession, though not for long. Like the “Exorcist” relic, the opal proves an ominous if more contemporary fetish with a near-magical, increasingly dangerous hold on everyone who comes in contact with it. Howard believes that the opal will save him — he plans to sell it at auction — but like good fortune, the precious lump keeps slipping from his grasp. For the most part, the Safdies seem to enjoy mucking up Howard’s plans, intensifying his rotten luck, bad choices, collapsing home life and squabbles, pointless or otherwise. They bat him around, dunk him in a fountain, almost break his nose. He’s a Rabelaisian figure, absurd, lewd, excessive, and while the Safdies are obviously fond of him (the scenes with his children are a tip-off), they don’t cut him much slack. Life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short; the movie mostly is too, though at 135 minutes it’s not short. Sandler makes a persuasively unsteady hub for this pinwheeling anarchy. It’s an intensely physical role — Howard racks up the miles — and generally a reactive one. Every so often Sandler gets to expand the character’s emotional register, in lulls and moments of tenderness and real feeling. Then boom! He’s off again, diving into the clamor, trying to hustle the basketball star Kevin Garnett (as himself) or manage an unruly partner in his hustle (an excellent Lakeith Stanfield). Garnett delivers a speech to Howard about race and exploitation, which brings the story back to Ethiopia. Garnett’s sincerity may resonate with you, but with Howard? Not so much. Howard is running too quickly to really listen, and he doesn’t really care. The world is what it is, dog eat dog flimflam man, get rich or die trying. The Safdies don’t judge Howard or, worse yet, ask us to. Instead, they situate him in a specific historical moment (the year is 2012), throwing him into a late-capitalist, wholly transactional, anxiously insecure world. Deeply immersive, that world carries the imprint of its cinematic influences — bards of excess like Abel Ferrara, James Toback, Tony Scott and Gaspar Noé — but it is also and finally its own rough and glittering thing of beauty. Uncut Gems Rated R for gun violence, bloodletting and gambling. Running time: 2 hours 15 minutes."
224,Seberg,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/seberg-review-kristen-stewart.html,"“A man lit a fire and put me on it,” the actress Jean Seberg (Kristen Stewart) curtly tells her lover, the activist Hakim Jamal (Anthony Mackie), in “Seberg,” a flawed and fascinating film about fame and martyrdom. She’s explaining the burn scars she suffered while playing Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger’s “Saint Joan” (1957), but the comment could as easily serve as this movie’s tagline. Conflagration is a recurring motif. “You’re playing with fire,” Jamal warns, knowing the F.B.I. will notice her generous donations to civil rights causes and her association with the Black Panther movement. The year is 1968, and Seberg has left her home in Paris — as well as her husband, the writer Romain Gary (Yvan Attal), and their young son — to come to Los Angeles to audition for “Paint Your Wagon.” Her Black Power salute at the airport draws immediate attention, as does her nighttime visit to Jamal’s home in Compton wearing an arresting minidress and driving a sunshine-yellow convertible. Her actions seem less deliberately provocative than politically ingenuous, those of a woman unaware that her support for African-American rights will lead to the thorough violation of her own. Though inspired by real life, “Seberg,” directed by Benedict Andrews, isn’t a biopic. It’s a distressing, sometimes distracted portrait of a woman haunted and hounded, shamed and surveilled to the point of complete mental collapse. We see and hear virtually nothing of her early life or her movies, of the small-town Iowa native who became a star of the French New Wave at 21 and died at 40, overcome by barbiturates. Instead, Anna Waterhouse and Joe Shrapnel’s script spends too much time observing Seberg’s fictional and ultimately conscience-stricken nemesis, the F.B.I. Agent Jack Solomon (Jack O’Connell), whose spying and harassment will send her into emotional free-fall. Despite its wearying preoccupation with Bureau mischief and Solomon’s softening toward his target, “Seberg” has an old-fashioned glamour that can on occasion take your breath away. The styling and production design are impeccable, and Rachel Morrison’s radiant cinematography is as beguiling as Stewart’s performance. Glowing beneath Seberg’s famous blond pixie cut, confident yet fragile, she’s a picture of gorgeous disintegration. Andrews might have diluted her point of view and blurred his film’s focus, but when his star has his undivided attention, he knows how to set up a scene. Watch her pace nervously in her fishbowl of a house, dressed in a silk peignoir and clutching a drink, an irresistible target for anyone with a mind to stalk or photograph. Late in the movie, there’s one long, perfect shot — a rapturous synchronicity of sound and vision — where we see Seberg walk toward the camera on her husband’s arm while Scott Walker’s “It’s Raining Today” croons prophetically on the soundtrack. The song mourns a lover who’s already the fading memory that Seberg will become, and it seems to be saying we should have watched her more closely while we still could. Seberg Rated R for sex, spying and unidentified substances. Running time: 1 hour 36 minutes."
225,A Hidden Life,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/a-hidden-life-review.html,"Franz Jägerstätter, the Austrian farmer at the center of “A Hidden Life,” finds himself in a lot of arguments. He isn’t an especially contentious man — on the contrary, his manner is generally amiable and serene. But he has done something that people in his village and beyond find provocative, which is to refuse combat service in World War II. He won’t take the oath of loyalty to Adolf Hitler that is required of every Austrian soldier. Since this is a film by Terrence Malick, the arguments don’t take the usual stagy, back-and-forth, expository form. The words, in English and unsubtitled German, slide across the action, overlapping scenes, fading in and out, trailing off into music or the sounds of nature. At issue is not only Franz’s future — he risks a death sentence if he persists in his refusal — but also the meaning of his action. Most of the men (and they are mostly men) who try to dissuade him act in some degree of complicity with the Nazis. The mayor of St. Radegund, the mountain hamlet where Franz lives, is a true believer, spouting xenophobic, master-race rhetoric in the town’s beer garden. The Roman Catholic clergy — Franz visits the local priest and a nearby bishop — counsel quiet and compromise. Interrogators, bureaucrats and lawyers, including Franz’s defense attorney, try to make him see reason. His stubbornness won’t change anything, they say, and will only hurt his family. His actions are selfish and vain, his sacrifice pointless. And Franz (August Diehl) is not the only one who suffers. He is imprisoned, first in a rural jail and then in Berlin’s Tegel prison. Some of the words we hear on the soundtrack are drawn from the letters that pass between him and his wife, Franziska (Valerie Pachner). She stays behind to tend the farm with her sister and mother-in-law, and also to endure the hostility of the neighbors. The film is divided between Franz’s and Franziska’s points of view, and returns to images of them together with their three daughters against a backdrop of fields and mountains — pictures of everyday life and also of an earthly paradise that can withstand human evil. The arresting visual beauty of “A Hidden Life,” which was shot by Joerg Widmer, is essential to its own argument, and to Franz’s ethical and spiritual rebuttal to the concerns of his persecutors and would-be allies. The topography of the valley is spectacular, but so are the churches and cathedrals. Even the cells and offices are infused with an aesthetic intensity at once sensual and picturesque. The hallmarks of Malick’s later style are here: the upward tilt of the camera to capture new vistas of sky and landscape; the brisk gliding along rivers and roads; the elegant cutting between the human and natural worlds; the reverence for music and the mistrust of speech. (The score is by James Newton Howard.) But this is the most linear and, in spite of its nearly three-hour length, the most concentrated film he has made in a long time. More than “To the Wonder” or “Knight of Cups” or even the sublime “Tree of Life,” it tells a story with a beginning, a middle and end, and a moral. Malick’s lyricism sometimes washes out the psychological and historical details of the narrative. The political context is minimal, supplied by documentary footage of Nazi rallies at the beginning and Hitler at home in the middle. The performers don’t so much act as manifest conditions of being, like figures in a religious painting. Which may be the best way to understand “A Hidden Life.” The real Franz Jägerstätter was beatified in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI, who grew up in a part of Bavaria not far, geographically or culturally, from St. Radegund. The film is an affirmation of its hero’s holiness, a chronicle of goodness and suffering that is both moving and mysterious. The mystery — and the possible lesson for the present — dwells in the question of Franz’s motive. Why, of all the people in St. Radegund, was he alone willing to defy fascism, to see through its appeal to the core of its immorality? His fellow burghers, including the mayor, are not depicted as monstrous. On the contrary, they are normal representatives of their time and place. Franz, whose father was killed in World War I, who works the land with a steady hand, a loyal wife and three fair-haired children, seems like both an ideal target of Nazi propaganda and an embodiment of the Aryan ideal. How did he see through the ideology so completely? The answer has to do with his goodness, a quality the movie sometimes reduces to — or expresses in terms of — his good looks. Diehl and Pachner are both charismatic, but their performances amount mainly to a series of radiant poses and anguished faces. Franz is not an activist; he isn’t connected to any organized resistance to Hitler, and he expresses his opposition in the most general moral terms. Nazism itself is depicted a bit abstractly, a matter of symbols and attitudes and stock images rather than specifically mobilized hatreds. When the mayor rants about impure races, either he or the screenplay is too decorous to mention Jews. And this, I suppose, is my own argument with this earnest, gorgeous, at times frustrating film. Or perhaps a confession of my intellectual biases, which at least sometimes give priority to historical and political insight over matters of art and spirit. Franz Jägerstätter’s defiance of evil is moving and inspiring, and I wish I understood it better. A Hidden Life Rated PG-13. Evil in the midst of beauty, and vice versa. In English and German, without subtitles. Running time: 2 hours 53 minutes."
226,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/movies/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review.html,"Not that anybody has asked, but if I had to come up with a definitive ranking of all the “Star Wars” episodes — leaving out sidebars like the animated “Clone Wars,” the young Han Solo movie and the latest “Mandalorian” Baby Yoda memes — the result could only be a nine-way tie for fourth place. You know I’m right, even if you insist on making a case for “The Empire Strikes Back” or “The Last Jedi,” to name the two installments that are usually cited as the best individual movies. (Please do not insist.) At least since “The Return of the Jedi” (1983), the point of each chapter has been consolidation rather than distinction. For a single film to risk being too interesting would be to imperil the long-term strategy of cultivating a multigenerational, multinational fandom. “The Rise of Skywalker” — Episode IX, in case you’ve lost count — is one of the best. Also one of the worst. Perfectly middling. It all amounts to the same thing. In retrospect, it’s clear that the series has evolved — or was designed, if you favor that theology — to average out over time, to be good enough for its various and expanding constituencies without alienating any of them. Over the years, my own allegiances have shifted. When I was a kid back in the “New Hope” era, I liked the action and the wisecracks and Princess Leia. By the end of Anakin Skywalker’s grim journey to the Dark Side in “Revenge of the Sith” I had developed a scholarly preoccupation with the political theory of galactic imperialism. More recently I’ve grown fond of some of the cute new droids and space creatures, and also of the spunky resistance fighters with their one-syllable names. Rey. Finn. Poe. They are back, of course — played with unflagging conviction by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac. Also back is everyone’s favorite Dark-Side-curious emo-Jedi bad boyfriend, Mr. Kylo Ren, formerly known as Ben Solo and irrefutably embodied by Adam Driver. I will say very little about what any of these people — or C-3PO, Chewbacca, BB-8 and any new characters or surprises — actually do for two and a half hours, because the spoiler-sensitive constituency is especially large and vocal. Also because they do and say quite a lot. “The Rise of Skywalker” has at least five hours worth of plot, and if that’s your particular fetish, I’m not going to get in the way of your fun. Suffice to say that various items need to be collected from planets with exotic names, and that bad guys cackle and rant on the bridges of massive spaceships while good guys zip around bravely doing the work of resistance. Mysteries are solved. Sacrifices are made. Fights are fought in the air, on the ground and in deep cavernous spaces where … but that’s enough for now. The director is J.J. Abrams, perhaps the most consistent B student in modern popular culture. He has shepherded George Lucas’s mythomaniacal creations in the Disney era, making the old galaxy a more diverse and also a less idiosyncratic place. Rian Johnson, who wrote and directed “The Last Jedi,” injected some rich color and complicated emotion into the chronicles of domination and rebellion, and also a dash of iconoclastic energy. The bond between Rey and Kylo felt both politically dangerous and sexually provocative, while Rey’s obscure origins suggested that the rebels might finally come to represent something more genuinely democratic than the enlightened wing of the galactic ruling class. Abrams, who also directed “The Force Awakens,” the first chapter in this trilogy, suppresses that potential, reaffirming the historic “Star Wars” commitment to dynastic bloodlines and messianic mumbo-jumbo, even as he ends on a note of huggy, smiley pseudo-populism. The whole Kylo-Rey thing turns out to involve their grandparents, which is kind of weird, though it could have added a shiver of gothic creepiness to the story. Ridley and Driver are downright valiant in their pursuit of tragic dignity in increasingly preposterous circumstances. Abrams is too slick and shallow a filmmaker to endow the dramas of repression and insurgency, of family fate and individual destiny, of solidarity and the will to power, with their full moral and metaphysical weight. At the same time, his pseudo-visionary self-importance won’t allow him to surrender to whimsy or mischief. The struggle of good against evil feels less like a cosmic battle than a longstanding sports rivalry between teams whose glory days are receding. The head coaches come and go, the uniforms are redesigned, certain key players are the subjects of trade rumors, and the fans keep showing up. Which is not entirely terrible. “The Rise of Skywalker” isn’t a great “Star Wars” movie, but that may be because there is no such thing. That seems to be the way we like it. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Rated PG-13. Kylo feels really bad. Running time: 2 hours 22 minutes."
227,Cats,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/movies/cats-review.html,"It is tough to pinpoint when the kitschapalooza called “Cats” reaches its zenith or its nadir, which are one and the same. The choices are legion: Judi Dench gliding in as Old Deuteronomy, a Yoda-esque fluff ball with a huge ruff who brings to mind the Cowardly Lion en route to a drag ball as Queen Elizabeth I; the tap dancing Skimbleshanks (Steven McRae), dressed, unlike most of the furries — in red pants and suspenders, no less — leading a Pied Piper parade; or Taylor Swift, as Bombalurina, executing a joyless burlesque shimmy after descending on the scene astride a crescent moon that ejaculates iridescent catnip. I could go on and must go on — yet how to explain the seemingly unexplainable, beginning with a narrative and language that borders on the gnomic? A doctoral thesis could be written on how this misfire sputtered into existence, though there’s nothing new about the movies’ energetic embrace of bad taste. One problem is that “Cats” was directed by Tom Hooper, a well-behaved journeyman (“The King’s Speech”), who is nowhere near vulgar enough for the challenge he was hired for, which is to translate Andrew Lloyd Webber’s money-printing musical to the big screen. Certainly Hooper has made a robust effort, as suggested by all the busy leaping, pirouetting, stretching, caterwauling and meowing. To help make the transition to the screen he’s enlisted some talented performers to slink and sing, including Francesca Hayward, a principal dancer for the Royal Ballet making her movie debut as Victoria. The original musical involves a clowder of cats with its own lingo (“Jellicle”) that convenes on the night one is chosen to be reborn. This cat Christ element remains in the movie, which was written by Hooper and Lee Hall. But now the focus has shifted to Victoria, an abandoned kitty who sets off on a heroic journey amid swishing tails, bumping heads and hisses. The genesis for the movie stretches back to the 1970s when Lloyd Webber began adapting T.S. Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” for the stage. First published in 1939, “Old Possum’s” is a collection of poems about cats with names like Growltiger, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer. The poems are often described as whimsical, but if they’re not your cup of twee they can grate. It was Ezra Pound, calling himself Brer Rabbit, who gave Eliot the nickname Old Possum, another moniker borrowed from Joel Chandler Harris’s “Uncle Remus” collection of African-American folklore. Eliot and Pound apparently liked writing to each other in the dialect used in “Remus,” in a kind of literary minstrelsy. For his “Cats,” Lloyd Webber mostly set Eliot’s light verse to music. Trevor Nunn, who directed the original London production in 1981, provided lyrics for the show’s most famous tear-duct pumper, “Memory,” sung by a forlorn outcast, Grizabella. A badly served Jennifer Hudson, cowering and belting with rivers of tears and snot, plays this mangy-looking stray in furs, who here suggests a Park Avenue pet terminally down on her luck. (Nunn’s inspiration was Eliot’s beautiful “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” a non-“Possum” poem, which reads in part: “Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter/Slips out its tongue/And devours a morsel of rancid butter.”) Transposing “Cats” to the screen was always going to be difficult, particularly once the decision was made to create a live-action version rather than an animated one. Traditional theater depends on the viewer’s going along with a very delicate balance of reality and unreality that comes when viewers breathe the same air and share the same space as live actors; movies create a different reality effect or, if you insist, magic. Part of the pleasure of theater (if you’re a partisan) is this human factor; but without the presence of hard-working troupers in fun fur in this “Cats,” all that’s left are canned images of fit-looking people meowing and raising their rumps high in the air. The bobbing butts have their obvious appeal. But Hooper’s mistake is that he’s tried to class up the joint. What a blunder! In feline terms, this is a movie without epic hairballs, without rear-end sniffing, without a deep, wounding scratch. Instead the movie tamps down and tidies its innate strangeness, cutting carefully loose only in its more comic numbers. By far the best in show in this respect are James Corden, wittily frolicking amid trash as Bustopher Jones; and Rebel Wilson, whose spoiled Jennyanydots leads a Busby Berkeleyesque jaw-dropper with a warbling (quavering) company of mice and a parade of high-stepping, kaleidoscopically trained cockroaches. Generally, Hooper pulls away from loony-tunes excess, tries for sexy rather than freaky, and plucks at heartstrings, a reflex that pulls the story into mawkishness, particularly when he cuts to Victoria. Hayward is a lovely, supple dancer, who brings some depth to her character purely through movement. Here, though, her face mostly conveys blurred yearning and all those close-ups suggest a director struggling to get more from an actor. It’s too bad that no one seems to have thought through the semiotics of Victoria’s chalky white cat face, given that Hayward is of mixed race and that the heavy is Idris Elba’s predatory Macavity. Elba seems to be having a fine time, but come on! Cats Rated PG for who knows what. Perhaps catnip? Running time: 1 hour 49 minutes."
228,Spies in Disguise,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/movies/spies-in-disguise-review.html,"Will Smith voices an “is there anything he can’t do?” secret agent whose massive skills are dwarfed by his humongous ego in “Spies in Disguise,” a colorful but not very eye-opening animated offering from Blue Sky, the studio that brought us the “Ice Age” diversions. The character is an amiable-to-the-point-of-toothless sendup of Smith’s celebrity persona and many of the roles he’s played. His super spy Lance Sterling is framed for treason by a sneering villain with a robotic claw hand. When the agency pursues Lance, he goes on the lam and seeks help from a colleague. The gizmo inventor Walter Beckett (voiced by Tom Holland), a young man of floppy hair and poignant back story, contrives the perfect (or so Walter believes) cover for Lance. He turns him into a pigeon. There’s much lip-smacking (not the good kind) humor concerning the waste elimination functions of the bird (the most memorable banter has Walter explaining to Lance what a cloaca is) and the weird proclivities of the real birds who attach themselves to Lance. Soon enough this stuff gives way, partially at least, to homilies on teamwork and friendship. The lessons are so treacly, and their delivery method so single-minded, that the Valley Girl phrase “gag me with a spoon” springs to mind. But you have to give the movie credit for sticking to its lack of guns. Walter can’t stand the prospect of wounding even the worst of baddies, so his arsenal consists of weapons of charming distraction. The movie’s finale, with its panoply of glitter bombs and oversize “awww”-inspiring flying cat GIFs, well-timed by the directors Troy Quane and Nick Bruno, works up some undeniable charm. Spies in Disguise Rated PG, probably for the robotic-claw-hand villain, who’s a little intense. Running time: 1 hour 41 minutes."
229,Little Women,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/movies/little-women-review.html,"“Christmas won’t be Christmas without any presents.” That’s the first sentence of “Little Women,” and I’m happy to say that in this gloomy holiday season — when so much of humanity has earned Krampus or coal — the new movie version of Louisa May Alcott’s novel comes as an absolute gift. A whole stocking full, really. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, this “Little Women” — the latest of many adaptations — embraces its source material with eager enthusiasm rather than timid reverence. It is faithful enough to satisfy the book’s passionate devotees, who will recognize the work of a kindred spirit, while standing on its own as an independent and inventive piece of contemporary popular culture. Without resorting to self-conscious anachronism or fussy antiquarianism, Gerwig has fashioned a story that feels at once entirely true to its 19th-century origins and utterly modern.  Some of that freshness comes from the cast, a cornucopia of effervescent young talent ballasted by a handful of doughty old-timers. There is also an exuberance — an appetite for clothes, books, baked goods and adventure — that effortlessly links then to now. At the center of the hullabaloo, as she was in Gerwig’s “Lady Bird,” is Saoirse Ronan. She plays Jo March, the second oldest of four sisters living in Concord, Mass., during and after the Civil War. The foursome varies by temperament and talent, inviting a mix-and-match game of identification and infatuation. The oldest, Meg (Emma Watson) is theatrical and responsible; Beth (Eliza Scanlen) is musical and sweet. The youngest sister, Amy (Florence Pugh), and Jo are a painter and a writer who are frequently at odds. Before romance, tragedy and the ordinary pains of growing up complicate matters, they are an inseparable if not always harmonious troupe. Jo writes the plays that the rest of them perform for an audience that includes various toys, their mother (Laura Dern) and Hannah (Jayne Houdyshell), the housekeeper. But the sisters live mainly to delight (and sometimes to torment) one another. The spectacle of their natural, affectionate, clamorous intimacy is a joy to behold, one we occasionally glimpse through the amused eyes of potential suitors, fond neighbors and a prodigiously judgmental and very wealthy aunt played by Meryl Streep. The girls’ nonjudgmental, non-wealthy father is played by Bob Odenkirk. Rather than starting where Alcott does, during an austere wartime Christmas, Gerwig introduces us to Jo seven years later, an ink-stained scribbler paying a visit to a New York publisher (Tracy Letts). The rest of “Little Women” zigzags between two periods in the lives of Jo and her family. Whereas Alcott traces their fates in a straight line, Gerwig (aided by the deft editing of Nick Houy and the musical stitching of Alexandre Desplat’s score) proceeds by association and recollection. It’s as if the book has been carefully cut apart and reassembled, its signatures sewn back together in an order that produces sparks of surprise and occasional bouts of pleasurable dizziness. This chronological shuffling jolts the story awake and nudges the viewer to pay close attention. Like any good novelist and every great filmmaker, Gerwig isn’t afraid to let her audience work a little. She trusts our intelligence and our curiosity, and also her own command of the medium. Reshuffling the plot is a way of making “Little Women” more cinematic without resorting to tricks or gimmicks. As much as “The Irishman” or “Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood,” this is a film that tackles the mysteries of time. In Gerwig’s hands, the specific magic of the medium — its ability to reorder the sequence of events, to slow down and speed up, to project memory ahead of experience — becomes a tool of philosophical and emotional inquiry. We observe the March sisters becoming who we have always known them to be, and also figuring out, for themselves, who they are. Their simultaneous comings-of-age take place amid the constraints and opportunities of their time, place, class and gender. The publisher who buys Jo’s sensational tales instructs her that women in fiction must wind up either married or dead, and “Little Women” the movie obeys that imperative, though not in quite the same way that “Little Women” the novel does. Romance arrives in the person of young Teddy Laurence (Timothée Chalamet), the slightly dissolute grandson of a wealthy Concord widower (Chris Cooper). Laurie, as the sisters call him, seems at times more like a fifth March sister or an untrained puppy than like boyfriend material. He can’t even sit properly in a chair! Meg, by consensus the prettiest of the four, falls for Laurie’s tutor (James Norton), which means that her wedding vow is also a vow of poverty. The more practical-minded Amy, counseled by Aunt March, grasps the economic implications of marriage. Jo, who catches the eye of both Laurie and a certain Professor Bhaer (Louis Garrel), might prefer not to marry at all. The question of freedom — in particular of a woman’s independence in a society that is both liberal and governed by tradition — is threaded through nearly every scene. “I’ve been angry every day of my life,” Mrs. March says matter-of-factly, and while “Little Women” is full of silliness and sorrow, sweetness and warmth, it doesn’t minimize or apologize for that anger. Nor does it mock or marginalize the March family’s commitment to social justice, civic responsibility and artistic excellence. All of those were, for Alcott, part of the mainstream of American culture. Gerwig knows that they still are. And so is this kind of entertainment: generous, sincere, full of critical intelligence and honest sentiment, self-aware without the slightest hint of cynicism, grounded in the particulars of life and accessible to everyone. Don’t let the diminutive title fool you. “Little Women” is major. It seems fitting to finish with Alcott’s last sentence: “I can never wish you a greater happiness than this!” Little Women Rated PG. Domestic struggles. Running time: 2 hours 14 minutes."
230,1917,http://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/24/movies/1917-review.html,"On June 28, 1914, a young Serbian nationalist assassinated the presumptive heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, thus starting World War I. That, at any rate, is the familiar way that the origins for this war have been shaped into a story, even if historians agree the genesis of the conflict is far more complicated. None of those complications and next to no history, though, have made it into “1917,” a carefully organized and sanitized war picture from Sam Mendes that turns one of the most catastrophic episodes in modern times into an exercise in preening showmanship. The story is simple. It opens on April 6, 1917, with Lance Corporal Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Lance Corporal Schofield (George MacKay), British soldiers stationed in France, receiving new orders. They are to deliver a message to troops at the front line who are readying an assault on the Germans, who have retreated. (Coincidentally or not, April 6 is the date that the United States formally entered the war.) The British command, however, believes that the German withdrawal is a trap, an operational Trojan horse. The two messengers need to carry the dispatch ordering the waiting British troops to stand down, thereby saving countless lives. It’s the usual action-movie setup — a mission, extraordinary odds, ready-made heroes — but with trenches, barbed wire and a largely faceless threat. Blake jumps on the assignment because his brother is among the troops preparing the assault. Schofield takes orders more reluctantly, having already survived the Battle of the Somme, with its million-plus casualties. The modest difference in attitude between the messengers will vanish, presumably because any real criticism — including any skepticism about this or any war — might impede the movie’s embrace of heroic individualism for the greater good, which here largely translates as vague national struggle and sacrifice. What complicates the movie is that it has been created to look like it was made with a single continuous shot. In service of this illusion, the editing has been obscured, though there are instances — an abrupt transition to black, an eruption of thick dust — where the seams almost show. Throughout, the camera remains fluid, its point of view unfixed. At times, it shows you what Blake and Schofield see, though it sometimes moves like another character. Like a silent yet aggressively restless unit member, it rushes before or alongside or behind the messengers as they snake through the mazy trenches and cross into No Man’s Land, the nightmarish expanse between the fronts. The idea behind the camerawork seems to be to bring viewers close to the action, so you can share what Blake and Schofield endure each step of the way. Mostly, though, the illusion of seamlessness draws attention away from the messengers, who are only lightly sketched in, and toward Roger Deakins’s cinematography and, by extension, Mendes’s filmmaking. Whether the camera is figuratively breathing down Blake’s and Schofield’s necks or pulling back to show them creeping inside a water-filled crater as big as a swimming pool, you are always keenly aware of the technical hurdles involved in getting the characters from here to there, from this trench to that crater. In another movie, such demonstrative self-reflexivity might have been deployed to productive effect; here, it registers as grandstanding. It’s too bad and it’s frustrating, because the two leads make appealing company: The round-faced Chapman brings loose, affable charm to his role, while MacKay, a talented actor who’s all sharp angles, primarily delivers reactive intensity. This lack of nuance can be blamed on Mendes, who throughout seems far more interested in the movie’s machinery than in the human costs of war or the attendant subjects — sacrifice, patriotism and so on — that puff into view like little wisps of engine steam. The absence of history ensures that “1917” remains a palatable war simulation, the kind in which every button on every uniform has been diligently recreated, and no wound, no blown-off limb, is ghastly enough to truly horrify the audience. Here, everything looks authentic but manicured, ordered, sane, sterile. Save for a quick appearance by Andrew Scott, as an officer whose overly bright eyes and jaundiced affect suggest he’s been too long in the trenches, nothing gestures at madness. Worse, the longer this amazing race continues, the more it resembles an obstacle course by way of an Indiana Jones-style adventure, complete with a showstopping plane crash and battlefield sprint. Mendes, who wrote the script with Krysty Wilson-Cairns, has included a note of dedication to his grandfather, Alfred H. Mendes, who served in World War I. It’s the most personal moment in a movie that, beyond its technical virtues, is intriguing only because of Britain’s current moment. Certainly, the country’s acrimonious withdrawal from the European Union makes a notable contrast with the onscreen camaraderie. And while the budget probably explains why most of the superior officers who pop in briefly are played by name actors — Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch — their casting also adds distinctly royal filigree to the ostensibly democratic mix. 1917 Rated R for war violence. Running time: 1 hour 58 minutes."
