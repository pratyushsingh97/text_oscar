# Text Oscar

## Background
This project is the first of a personal challenge of mine in 2020 -- build a proof-of-concept in a weekend. Text Oscar was all built in one weekend a couple weeks ago, and I liked this project enough that I am slowly fleshing out the code to make it a legitimate product. Obviously, if you see some ideas that you would like to add, simply open a pull-request or contribute to the project directly :). 

## What is Text Oscar?
Ever run into a situation where you don't know what a movie is about? You would like to know who that movie casts, the director, the rating, along with what the critics are saying? Fear not, TextOscar is here to help. You simply text Oscar the movie name and it returns all of that information. 


## How does it work?
